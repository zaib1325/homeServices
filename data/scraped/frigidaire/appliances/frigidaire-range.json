Are the burners failing to ignite? Or perhaps the control panel is unresponsive? These common issues can disrupt your cooking routine, but understanding their causes can help you determine whether simple maintenance, DIY repairs, or professional service is your best next step. Our comprehensive guide combines technical expertise with practical solutions to address the most frequent Frigidaire range problems.\nUnderstanding Your Frigidaire Range Components\nEvery Frigidaire range, whether gas or electric, combines several key systems that work together to deliver reliable cooking performance. Electric models use precision heating elements for both cooktop and oven functions, while gas models employ a network of valves, igniters, and burners to create and control cooking heat. The control system—which may be simple knobs or a sophisticated digital interface—acts as the command center for all functions.\nWith regular maintenance and timely repairs when issues arise, your Frigidaire range can provide many years of dependable service for all your cooking needs.\nTroubleshooting Electric Frigidaire Range Problems\nSurface Burner Issues\nWhen electric cooktop elements fail to heat properly, the problem usually stems from one of these common causes:\n\n\nDamaged Heating Element: After years of use, elements can develop weak spots, breaks, or visible damage that affects their performance\n\n\nFaulty Burner Receptacle: The socket that connects the element to the range's electrical system can deteriorate from heat cycling\n\n\nConnection Problems: Loose or corroded connections between components can cause intermittent heating\n\n\nControl Switch Failure: The switch that regulates power to the element may be malfunctioning\n\n\nHow to Check: Carefully swap a problematic burner with one you know works well. If the problem moves with the element, you need a replacement element. If the problem stays in the same location, the receptacle or wiring likely needs attention.\nOven Not Heating Correctly\nWhen your Frigidaire electric oven fails to heat properly, check for these common culprits:\n\n\nFailed Bake Element: Look for visible damage like blisters, breaks, or discoloration on the element at the oven bottom\n\n\nDefective Broil Element: The upper element may have failed, affecting overall heating and broiling function\n\n\nTemperature Sensor Problems: A faulty sensor can cause inaccurate temperature regulation\n\n\nControl Board Issues: The electronic \"brain\" of the oven may be malfunctioning, causing heating inconsistencies\n\n\nVisual Inspection Tip: With the oven cool and power disconnected, examine the bake element for visible breaks or blistering. Damage usually indicates the element needs replacement.\nWhen you’re unable to find and resolve a range problem on your own, schedule stove repair and we’ll send a Sears Home Services technician to your home to fix the problem for you.\nDiagnosing Gas Frigidaire Range Problems\nCooktop Burner Difficulties\nGas burners that won't light or heat inconsistently typically point to these issues:\n\n\nIgniter Failure: The spark igniter may be cracked, misaligned, or electrically faulty\n\n\nClogged Burner Ports: Food spillover can block gas flow through the burner openings\n\n\nGas Supply Problems: Verify the gas valve is fully open and supplying all burners\n\n\nControl Valve Issues: The valve regulating gas flow to the burner may be malfunctioning\n\n\nSafety First: If you smell gas, immediately turn off the gas supply valve, avoid creating sparks or flames, ventilate the area, and call for professional service.\nOven Heating Failures\nGas oven problems usually involve these components:\n\n\nWeak or Failed Igniter: The \"glow bar\" igniter must get hot enough to open the safety valve; as igniters age, they may glow but not reach sufficient temperature\n\n\nGas Safety Valve Problems: The valve controlling gas flow to the oven burner may be stuck or failing\n\n\nFaulty Temperature Regulation: Issues with the thermostat or temperature sensor can cause inconsistent heating\n\n\nControl Module Failures: Electronic controls can malfunction, affecting all oven functions\n\n\nKey Symptom: If your igniter glows for more than 90 seconds without lighting the burner, it's likely too weak to open the safety valve and needs replacement.\nWhen you’re unable to resolve an oven heating problem on your own, schedule Frigidaire range repair service and we’ll send a technician to your home to fix the oven.\nElectronic Control and Display Problems\nModern Frigidaire ranges often feature sophisticated control systems that can experience unique issues:\n\n\nUnresponsive Touchpads: Control panels may stop responding to touch or button presses\n\n\nError Code Displays: Digital screens may show specific error codes indicating particular failures\n\n\nErratic Operation: Ranges may turn on/off unexpectedly or change settings without input\n\n\nPower Issues: Control boards can be affected by power surges or internal component failures\n\n\nQuick Fix Attempt: For many electronic issues, resetting the range can help. Disconnect power for 1-2 minutes by unplugging the range or turning off the circuit breaker, then restore power.\nFor smart-enabled Frigidaire ranges, connectivity problems may involve:\n\n\nWiFi module malfunction\n\n\nHome network configuration issues\n\n\nSoftware or firmware that needs updating\n\n\nAccount or app synchronization problems\n\n\nReal-World Repair Success Stories\nCase Study: Control Board Replacement Saves Expensive Range\nA family with a Frigidaire Gallery Series electric range experienced frequent shutoffs, error codes, and an unresponsive touchpad. Assuming these symptoms meant the end for their appliance, they were preparing to purchase a replacement. However, professional diagnosis identified a failing electronic control board as the sole issue.\nA certified technician replaced just this component—a repair costing significantly less than a new range. The appliance returned to perfect working condition, saving the family considerable expense and the inconvenience of selecting and installing a new range.\nCase Study: The Importance of Proper Diagnosis\nAfter replacing the igniter in their gas oven based on internet advice, a homeowner was frustrated when heating problems persisted. Professional diagnosis revealed that while the new igniter was working correctly, the gas safety valve wasn't opening fully due to an electrical issue in the control system.\nThis case highlights the value of accurate professional diagnosis—identifying the actual cause rather than just addressing symptoms based on common problems.\nPreventative Maintenance for Your Frigidaire Range\nRegular appliance maintenance significantly extends your range's lifespan and prevents many common issues.\nFor Electric Ranges:\n\n\nKeep surface elements clean from food buildup\n\n\nCheck for loose connections at element receptacles\n\n\nClean the oven interior regularly to prevent residue from burning onto elements\n\n\nVerify that drip pans are clean and properly positioned\n\n\nFor Gas Ranges:\n\n\nClean burner caps and ports regularly to ensure proper gas flow\n\n\nInspect igniter electrodes for food debris or misalignment\n\n\nCheck for loose gas connections (if you smell gas, call for service immediately)\n\n\nEnsure burner grates sit properly on the cooktop\n\n\nGeneral Maintenance:\n\n\nWipe up spills promptly to prevent baked-on residue\n\n\nClean control knobs and panels with appropriate non-abrasive cleaners\n\n\nCheck door gaskets for tears or gaps that might affect oven efficiency\n\n\nFollow manufacturer guidelines for self-cleaning functions to avoid component stress\n\n\nWhen Professional Frigidaire Range Repair Is Necessary\nWhile some maintenance is DIY-friendly, certain situations require professional range repair expertise:\n\n\nGas-Related Issues: Any problem involving gas connections or persistent gas odors\n\n\nElectrical Repairs: Internal wiring problems or electronic control failures\n\n\nCalibration Needs: Precise temperature adjustment requires specialized tools\n\n\nPersistent Problems: Issues that continue after basic troubleshooting\n\n\nComponent Replacement: Many internal parts require technical knowledge for proper installation\n\n\nSafety Priority: Always disconnect power before attempting electric range inspections. For gas ranges, never attempt to repair gas-specific components unless you have professional training.\nWhy Choose Sears Home Services for Your Frigidaire Range Repair\nWhen your Frigidaire range needs professional attention, Sears Home Services offers significant advantages:\n\n\nManufacturer-Specific Training: Our technicians receive specialized training on Frigidaire appliances\n\n\nGenuine Replacement Parts: We use only authentic Frigidaire components designed for your specific model\n\n\nDiagnostic Expertise: Our systematic troubleshooting identifies root causes, not just symptoms\n\n\nNationwide Service Network: Consistent quality standards wherever you're located\n\n\nService Guarantee: We stand behind our repairs with solid warranty coverage\n\n\nOur technicians have successfully completed over 100,000 Frigidaire range repairs, building unmatched expertise with these appliances.\nSchedule Your Frigidaire Range Repair Today\nDon't let cooking problems persist.

The control system—which may be simple knobs or a sophisticated digital interface—acts as the command center for all functions.\nWith regular maintenance and timely repairs when issues arise, your Frigidaire range can provide many years of dependable service for all your cooking needs.\nTroubleshooting Electric Frigidaire Range Problems\nSurface Burner Issues\nWhen electric cooktop elements fail to heat properly, the problem usually stems from one of these common causes:\n\n\nDamaged Heating Element: After years of use, elements can develop weak spots, breaks, or visible damage that affects their performance\n\n\nFaulty Burner Receptacle: The socket that connects the element to the range's electrical system can deteriorate from heat cycling\n\n\nConnection Problems: Loose or corroded connections between components can cause intermittent heating\n\n\nControl Switch Failure: The switch that regulates power to the element may be malfunctioning\n\n\nHow to Check: Carefully swap a problematic burner with one you know works well. If the problem moves with the element, you need a replacement element. If the problem stays in the same location, the receptacle or wiring likely needs attention.\nOven Not Heating Correctly\nWhen your Frigidaire electric oven fails to heat properly, check for these common culprits:\n\n\nFailed Bake Element: Look for visible damage like blisters, breaks, or discoloration on the element at the oven bottom\n\n\nDefective Broil Element: The upper element may have failed, affecting overall heating and broiling function\n\n\nTemperature Sensor Problems: A faulty sensor can cause inaccurate temperature regulation\n\n\nControl Board Issues: The electronic \"brain\" of the oven may be malfunctioning, causing heating inconsistencies\n\n\nVisual Inspection Tip: With the oven cool and power disconnected, examine the bake element for visible breaks or blistering. Damage usually indicates the element needs replacement.\nWhen you’re unable to find and resolve a range problem on your own, schedule stove repair and we’ll send a Sears Home Services technician to your home to fix the problem for you.\nDiagnosing Gas Frigidaire Range Problems\nCooktop Burner Difficulties\nGas burners that won't light or heat inconsistently typically point to these issues:\n\n\nIgniter Failure: The spark igniter may be cracked, misaligned, or electrically faulty\n\n\nClogged Burner Ports: Food spillover can block gas flow through the burner openings\n\n\nGas Supply Problems: Verify the gas valve is fully open and supplying all burners\n\n\nControl Valve Issues: The valve regulating gas flow to the burner may be malfunctioning\n\n\nSafety First: If you smell gas, immediately turn off the gas supply valve, avoid creating sparks or flames, ventilate the area, and call for professional service.\nOven Heating Failures\nGas oven problems usually involve these components:\n\n\nWeak or Failed Igniter: The \"glow bar\" igniter must get hot enough to open the safety valve; as igniters age, they may glow but not reach sufficient temperature\n\n\nGas Safety Valve Problems: The valve controlling gas flow to the oven burner may be stuck or failing\n\n\nFaulty Temperature Regulation: Issues with the thermostat or temperature sensor can cause inconsistent heating\n\n\nControl Module Failures: Electronic controls can malfunction, affecting all oven functions\n\n\nKey Symptom: If your igniter glows for more than 90 seconds without lighting the burner, it's likely too weak to open the safety valve and needs replacement.\nWhen you’re unable to resolve an oven heating problem on your own, schedule Frigidaire range repair service and we’ll send a technician to your home to fix the oven.\nElectronic Control and Display Problems\nModern Frigidaire ranges often feature sophisticated control systems that can experience unique issues:\n\n\nUnresponsive Touchpads: Control panels may stop responding to touch or button presses\n\n\nError Code Displays: Digital screens may show specific error codes indicating particular failures\n\n\nErratic Operation: Ranges may turn on/off unexpectedly or change settings without input\n\n\nPower Issues: Control boards can be affected by power surges or internal component failures\n\n\nQuick Fix Attempt: For many electronic issues, resetting the range can help. Disconnect power for 1-2 minutes by unplugging the range or turning off the circuit breaker, then restore power.\nFor smart-enabled Frigidaire ranges, connectivity problems may involve:\n\n\nWiFi module malfunction\n\n\nHome network configuration issues\n\n\nSoftware or firmware that needs updating\n\n\nAccount or app synchronization problems\n\n\nReal-World Repair Success Stories\nCase Study: Control Board Replacement Saves Expensive Range\nA family with a Frigidaire Gallery Series electric range experienced frequent shutoffs, error codes, and an unresponsive touchpad. Assuming these symptoms meant the end for their appliance, they were preparing to purchase a replacement. However, professional diagnosis identified a failing electronic control board as the sole issue.\nA certified technician replaced just this component—a repair costing significantly less than a new range. The appliance returned to perfect working condition, saving the family considerable expense and the inconvenience of selecting and installing a new range.\nCase Study: The Importance of Proper Diagnosis\nAfter replacing the igniter in their gas oven based on internet advice, a homeowner was frustrated when heating problems persisted. Professional diagnosis revealed that while the new igniter was working correctly, the gas safety valve wasn't opening fully due to an electrical issue in the control system.\nThis case highlights the value of accurate professional diagnosis—identifying the actual cause rather than just addressing symptoms based on common problems.\nPreventative Maintenance for Your Frigidaire Range\nRegular appliance maintenance significantly extends your range's lifespan and prevents many common issues.\nFor Electric Ranges:\n\n\nKeep surface elements clean from food buildup\n\n\nCheck for loose connections at element receptacles\n\n\nClean the oven interior regularly to prevent residue from burning onto elements\n\n\nVerify that drip pans are clean and properly positioned\n\n\nFor Gas Ranges:\n\n\nClean burner caps and ports regularly to ensure proper gas flow\n\n\nInspect igniter electrodes for food debris or misalignment\n\n\nCheck for loose gas connections (if you smell gas, call for service immediately)\n\n\nEnsure burner grates sit properly on the cooktop\n\n\nGeneral Maintenance:\n\n\nWipe up spills promptly to prevent baked-on residue\n\n\nClean control knobs and panels with appropriate non-abrasive cleaners\n\n\nCheck door gaskets for tears or gaps that might affect oven efficiency\n\n\nFollow manufacturer guidelines for self-cleaning functions to avoid component stress\n\n\nWhen Professional Frigidaire Range Repair Is Necessary\nWhile some maintenance is DIY-friendly, certain situations require professional range repair expertise:\n\n\nGas-Related Issues: Any problem involving gas connections or persistent gas odors\n\n\nElectrical Repairs: Internal wiring problems or electronic control failures\n\n\nCalibration Needs: Precise temperature adjustment requires specialized tools\n\n\nPersistent Problems: Issues that continue after basic troubleshooting\n\n\nComponent Replacement: Many internal parts require technical knowledge for proper installation\n\n\nSafety Priority: Always disconnect power before attempting electric range inspections. For gas ranges, never attempt to repair gas-specific components unless you have professional training.\nWhy Choose Sears Home Services for Your Frigidaire Range Repair\nWhen your Frigidaire range needs professional attention, Sears Home Services offers significant advantages:\n\n\nManufacturer-Specific Training: Our technicians receive specialized training on Frigidaire appliances\n\n\nGenuine Replacement Parts: We use only authentic Frigidaire components designed for your specific model\n\n\nDiagnostic Expertise: Our systematic troubleshooting identifies root causes, not just symptoms\n\n\nNationwide Service Network: Consistent quality standards wherever you're located\n\n\nService Guarantee: We stand behind our repairs with solid warranty coverage\n\n\nOur technicians have successfully completed over 100,000 Frigidaire range repairs, building unmatched expertise with these appliances.\nSchedule Your Frigidaire Range Repair Today\nDon't let cooking problems persist.

Are the burners failing to ignite? Or perhaps the control panel is unresponsive? These common issues can disrupt your cooking routine, but understanding their causes can help you determine whether simple maintenance, DIY repairs, or professional service is your best next step. Our comprehensive guide combines technical expertise with practical solutions to address the most frequent Frigidaire range problems.\nUnderstanding Your Frigidaire Range Components\nEvery Frigidaire range, whether gas or electric, combines several key systems that work together to deliver reliable cooking performance. Electric models use precision heating elements for both cooktop and oven functions, while gas models employ a network of valves, igniters, and burners to create and control cooking heat. The control system—which may be simple knobs or a sophisticated digital interface—acts as the command center for all functions.\nWith regular maintenance and timely repairs when issues arise, your Frigidaire range can provide many years of dependable service for all your cooking needs.\nTroubleshooting Electric Frigidaire Range Problems\nSurface Burner Issues\nWhen electric cooktop elements fail to heat properly, the problem usually stems from one of these common causes:\n\n\nDamaged Heating Element: After years of use, elements can develop weak spots, breaks, or visible damage that affects their performance\n\n\nFaulty Burner Receptacle: The socket that connects the element to the range's electrical system can deteriorate from heat cycling\n\n\nConnection Problems: Loose or corroded connections between components can cause intermittent heating\n\n\nControl Switch Failure: The switch that regulates power to the element may be malfunctioning\n\n\nHow to Check: Carefully swap a problematic burner with one you know works well. If the problem moves with the element, you need a replacement element. If the problem stays in the same location, the receptacle or wiring likely needs attention.\nOven Not Heating Correctly\nWhen your Frigidaire electric oven fails to heat properly, check for these common culprits:\n\n\nFailed Bake Element: Look for visible damage like blisters, breaks, or discoloration on the element at the oven bottom\n\n\nDefective Broil Element: The upper element may have failed, affecting overall heating and broiling function\n\n\nTemperature Sensor Problems: A faulty sensor can cause inaccurate temperature regulation\n\n\nControl Board Issues: The electronic \"brain\" of the oven may be malfunctioning, causing heating inconsistencies\n\n\nVisual Inspection Tip: With the oven cool and power disconnected, examine the bake element for visible breaks or blistering. Damage usually indicates the element needs replacement.\nWhen you’re unable to find and resolve a range problem on your own, schedule stove repair and we’ll send a Sears Home Services technician to your home to fix the problem for you.\nDiagnosing Gas Frigidaire Range Problems\nCooktop Burner Difficulties\nGas burners that won't light or heat inconsistently typically point to these issues:\n\n\nIgniter Failure: The spark igniter may be cracked, misaligned, or electrically faulty\n\n\nClogged Burner Ports: Food spillover can block gas flow through the burner openings\n\n\nGas Supply Problems: Verify the gas valve is fully open and supplying all burners\n\n\nControl Valve Issues: The valve regulating gas flow to the burner may be malfunctioning\n\n\nSafety First: If you smell gas, immediately turn off the gas supply valve, avoid creating sparks or flames, ventilate the area, and call for professional service.\nOven Heating Failures\nGas oven problems usually involve these components:\n\n\nWeak or Failed Igniter: The \"glow bar\" igniter must get hot enough to open the safety valve; as igniters age, they may glow but not reach sufficient temperature\n\n\nGas Safety Valve Problems: The valve controlling gas flow to the oven burner may be stuck or failing\n\n\nFaulty Temperature Regulation: Issues with the thermostat or temperature sensor can cause inconsistent heating\n\n\nControl Module Failures: Electronic controls can malfunction, affecting all oven functions\n\n\nKey Symptom: If your igniter glows for more than 90 seconds without lighting the burner, it's likely too weak to open the safety valve and needs replacement.\nWhen you’re unable to resolve an oven heating problem on your own, schedule Frigidaire range repair service and we’ll send a technician to your home to fix the oven.\nElectronic Control and Display Problems\nModern Frigidaire ranges often feature sophisticated control systems that can experience unique issues:\n\n\nUnresponsive Touchpads: Control panels may stop responding to touch or button presses\n\n\nError Code Displays: Digital screens may show specific error codes indicating particular failures\n\n\nErratic Operation: Ranges may turn on/off unexpectedly or change settings without input\n\n\nPower Issues: Control boards can be affected by power surges or internal component failures\n\n\nQuick Fix Attempt: For many electronic issues, resetting the range can help. Disconnect power for 1-2 minutes by unplugging the range or turning off the circuit breaker, then restore power.\nFor smart-enabled Frigidaire ranges, connectivity problems may involve:\n\n\nWiFi module malfunction\n\n\nHome network configuration issues\n\n\nSoftware or firmware that needs updating\n\n\nAccount or app synchronization problems\n\n\nReal-World Repair Success Stories\nCase Study: Control Board Replacement Saves Expensive Range\nA family with a Frigidaire Gallery Series electric range experienced frequent shutoffs, error codes, and an unresponsive touchpad. Assuming these symptoms meant the end for their appliance, they were preparing to purchase a replacement. However, professional diagnosis identified a failing electronic control board as the sole issue.\nA certified technician replaced just this component—a repair costing significantly less than a new range. The appliance returned to perfect working condition, saving the family considerable expense and the inconvenience of selecting and installing a new range.\nCase Study: The Importance of Proper Diagnosis\nAfter replacing the igniter in their gas oven based on internet advice, a homeowner was frustrated when heating problems persisted. Professional diagnosis revealed that while the new igniter was working correctly, the gas safety valve wasn't opening fully due to an electrical issue in the control system.\nThis case highlights the value of accurate professional diagnosis—identifying the actual cause rather than just addressing symptoms based on common problems.\nPreventative Maintenance for Your Frigidaire Range\nRegular appliance maintenance significantly extends your range's lifespan and prevents many common issues.\nFor Electric Ranges:\n\n\nKeep surface elements clean from food buildup\n\n\nCheck for loose connections at element receptacles\n\n\nClean the oven interior regularly to prevent residue from burning onto elements\n\n\nVerify that drip pans are clean and properly positioned\n\n\nFor Gas Ranges:\n\n\nClean burner caps and ports regularly to ensure proper gas flow\n\n\nInspect igniter electrodes for food debris or misalignment\n\n\nCheck for loose gas connections (if you smell gas, call for service immediately)\n\n\nEnsure burner grates sit properly on the cooktop\n\n\nGeneral Maintenance:\n\n\nWipe up spills promptly to prevent baked-on residue\n\n\nClean control knobs and panels with appropriate non-abrasive cleaners\n\n\nCheck door gaskets for tears or gaps that might affect oven efficiency\n\n\nFollow manufacturer guidelines for self-cleaning functions to avoid component stress\n\n\nWhen Professional Frigidaire Range Repair Is Necessary\nWhile some maintenance is DIY-friendly, certain situations require professional range repair expertise:\n\n\nGas-Related Issues: Any problem involving gas connections or persistent gas odors\n\n\nElectrical Repairs: Internal wiring problems or electronic control failures\n\n\nCalibration Needs: Precise temperature adjustment requires specialized tools\n\n\nPersistent Problems: Issues that continue after basic troubleshooting\n\n\nComponent Replacement: Many internal parts require technical knowledge for proper installation\n\n\nSafety Priority: Always disconnect power before attempting electric range inspections. For gas ranges, never attempt to repair gas-specific components unless you have professional training.\nWhy Choose Sears Home Services for Your Frigidaire Range Repair\nWhen your Frigidaire range needs professional attention, Sears Home Services offers significant advantages:\n\n\nManufacturer-Specific Training: Our technicians receive specialized training on Frigidaire appliances\n\n\nGenuine Replacement Parts: We use only authentic Frigidaire components designed for your specific model\n\n\nDiagnostic Expertise: Our systematic troubleshooting identifies root causes, not just symptoms\n\n\nNationwide Service Network: Consistent quality standards wherever you're located\n\n\nService Guarantee: We stand behind our repairs with solid warranty coverage\n\n\nOur technicians have successfully completed over 100,000 Frigidaire range repairs, building unmatched expertise with these appliances.\nSchedule Your Frigidaire Range Repair Today\nDon't let cooking problems persist.

        "content": "Frigidaire Range Repair: Expert Solutions for Common Problems Is your Frigidaire range not heating correctly? Are the burners failing to ignite? Or perhaps the control panel is unresponsive? These common issues can disrupt your cooking routine, but understanding their causes can help you determine whether simple maintenance, DIY repairs, or professional service is your best next step. Our comprehensive guide combines technical expertise with practical solutions to address the most frequent Frigidaire range problems.\nUnderstanding Your Frigidaire Range Components\nEvery Frigidaire range, whether gas or electric, combines several key systems that work together to deliver reliable cooking performance. Electric models use precision heating elements for both cooktop and oven functions, while gas models employ a network of valves, igniters, and burners to create and control cooking heat. The control system—which may be simple knobs or a sophisticated digital interface—acts as the command center for all functions.\nWith regular maintenance and timely repairs when issues arise, your Frigidaire range can provide many years of dependable service for all your cooking needs.\nTroubleshooting Electric Frigidaire Range Problems\nSurface Burner Issues\nWhen electric cooktop elements fail to heat properly, the problem usually stems from one of these common causes:\n\n\nDamaged Heating Element: After years of use, elements can develop weak spots, breaks, or visible damage that affects their performance\n\n\nFaulty Burner Receptacle: The socket that connects the element to the range's electrical system can deteriorate from heat cycling\n\n\nConnection Problems: Loose or corroded connections between components can cause intermittent heating\n\n\nControl Switch Failure: The switch that regulates power to the element may be malfunctioning\n\n\nHow to Check: Carefully swap a problematic burner with one you know works well. If the problem moves with the element, you need a replacement element. If the problem stays in the same location, the receptacle or wiring likely needs attention.\nOven Not Heating Correctly\nWhen your Frigidaire electric oven fails to heat properly, check for these common culprits:\n\n\nFailed Bake Element: Look for visible damage like blisters, breaks, or discoloration on the element at the oven bottom\n\n\nDefective Broil Element: The upper element may have failed, affecting overall heating and broiling function\n\n\nTemperature Sensor Problems: A faulty sensor can cause inaccurate temperature regulation\n\n\nControl Board Issues: The electronic \"brain\" of the oven may be malfunctioning, causing heating inconsistencies\n\n\nVisual Inspection Tip: With the oven cool and power disconnected, examine the bake element for visible breaks or blistering. Damage usually indicates the element needs replacement.\nWhen you’re unable to find and resolve a range problem on your own, schedule stove repair and we’ll send a Sears Home Services technician to your home to fix the problem for you.\nDiagnosing Gas Frigidaire Range Problems\nCooktop Burner Difficulties\nGas burners that won't light or heat inconsistently typically point to these issues:\n\n\nIgniter Failure: The spark igniter may be cracked, misaligned, or electrically faulty\n\n\nClogged Burner Ports: Food spillover can block gas flow through the burner openings\n\n\nGas Supply Problems: Verify the gas valve is fully open and supplying all burners\n\n\nControl Valve Issues: The valve regulating gas flow to the burner may be malfunctioning\n\n\nSafety First: If you smell gas, immediately turn off the gas supply valve, avoid creating sparks or flames, ventilate the area, and call for professional service.\nOven Heating Failures\nGas oven problems usually involve these components:\n\n\nWeak or Failed Igniter: The \"glow bar\" igniter must get hot enough to open the safety valve; as igniters age, they may glow but not reach sufficient temperature\n\n\nGas Safety Valve Problems: The valve controlling gas flow to the oven burner may be stuck or failing\n\n\nFaulty Temperature Regulation: Issues with the thermostat or temperature sensor can cause inconsistent heating\n\n\nControl Module Failures: Electronic controls can malfunction, affecting all oven functions\n\n\nKey Symptom: If your igniter glows for more than 90 seconds without lighting the burner, it's likely too weak to open the safety valve and needs replacement.\nWhen you’re unable to resolve an oven heating problem on your own, schedule Frigidaire range repair service and we’ll send a technician to your home to fix the oven.\nElectronic Control and Display Problems\nModern Frigidaire ranges often feature sophisticated control systems that can experience unique issues:\n\n\nUnresponsive Touchpads: Control panels may stop responding to touch or button presses\n\n\nError Code Displays: Digital screens may show specific error codes indicating particular failures\n\n\nErratic Operation: Ranges may turn on/off unexpectedly or change settings without input\n\n\nPower Issues: Control boards can be affected by power surges or internal component failures\n\n\nQuick Fix Attempt: For many electronic issues, resetting the range can help. Disconnect power for 1-2 minutes by unplugging the range or turning off the circuit breaker, then restore power.\nFor smart-enabled Frigidaire ranges, connectivity problems may involve:\n\n\nWiFi module malfunction\n\n\nHome network configuration issues\n\n\nSoftware or firmware that needs updating\n\n\nAccount or app synchronization problems\n\n\nReal-World Repair Success Stories\nCase Study: Control Board Replacement Saves Expensive Range\nA family with a Frigidaire Gallery Series electric range experienced frequent shutoffs, error codes, and an unresponsive touchpad. Assuming these symptoms meant the end for their appliance, they were preparing to purchase a replacement. However, professional diagnosis identified a failing electronic control board as the sole issue.\nA certified technician replaced just this component—a repair costing significantly less than a new range. The appliance returned to perfect working condition, saving the family considerable expense and the inconvenience of selecting and installing a new range.\nCase Study: The Importance of Proper Diagnosis\nAfter replacing the igniter in their gas oven based on internet advice, a homeowner was frustrated when heating problems persisted. Professional diagnosis revealed that while the new igniter was working correctly, the gas safety valve wasn't opening fully due to an electrical issue in the control system.\nThis case highlights the value of accurate professional diagnosis—identifying the actual cause rather than just addressing symptoms based on common problems.\nPreventative Maintenance for Your Frigidaire Range\nRegular appliance maintenance significantly extends your range's lifespan and prevents many common issues.\nFor Electric Ranges:\n\n\nKeep surface elements clean from food buildup\n\n\nCheck for loose connections at element receptacles\n\n\nClean the oven interior regularly to prevent residue from burning onto elements\n\n\nVerify that drip pans are clean and properly positioned\n\n\nFor Gas Ranges:\n\n\nClean burner caps and ports regularly to ensure proper gas flow\n\n\nInspect igniter electrodes for food debris or misalignment\n\n\nCheck for loose gas connections (if you smell gas, call for service immediately)\n\n\nEnsure burner grates sit properly on the cooktop\n\n\nGeneral Maintenance:\n\n\nWipe up spills promptly to prevent baked-on residue\n\n\nClean control knobs and panels with appropriate non-abrasive cleaners\n\n\nCheck door gaskets for tears or gaps that might affect oven efficiency\n\n\nFollow manufacturer guidelines for self-cleaning functions to avoid component stress\n\n\nWhen Professional Frigidaire Range Repair Is Necessary\nWhile some maintenance is DIY-friendly, certain situations require professional range repair expertise:\n\n\nGas-Related Issues: Any problem involving gas connections or persistent gas odors\n\n\nElectrical Repairs: Internal wiring problems or electronic control failures\n\n\nCalibration Needs: Precise temperature adjustment requires specialized tools\n\n\nPersistent Problems: Issues that continue after basic troubleshooting\n\n\nComponent Replacement: Many internal parts require technical knowledge for proper installation\n\n\nSafety Priority: Always disconnect power before attempting electric range inspections. For gas ranges, never attempt to repair gas-specific components unless you have professional training.\nWhy Choose Sears Home Services for Your Frigidaire Range Repair\nWhen your Frigidaire range needs professional attention, Sears Home Services offers significant advantages:\n\n\nManufacturer-Specific Training: Our technicians receive specialized training on Frigidaire appliances\n\n\nGenuine Replacement Parts: We use only authentic Frigidaire components designed for your specific model\n\n\nDiagnostic Expertise: Our systematic troubleshooting identifies root causes, not just symptoms\n\n\nNationwide Service Network: Consistent quality standards wherever you're located\n\n\nService Guarantee: We stand behind our repairs with solid warranty coverage\n\n\nOur technicians have successfully completed over 100,000 Frigidaire range repairs, building unmatched expertise with these appliances.\nSchedule Your Frigidaire Range Repair Today\nDon't let cooking problems persist.

Disconnect power for 1-2 minutes by unplugging the range or turning off the circuit breaker, then restore power.\nFor smart-enabled Frigidaire ranges, connectivity problems may involve:\n\n\nWiFi module malfunction\n\n\nHome network configuration issues\n\n\nSoftware or firmware that needs updating\n\n\nAccount or app synchronization problems\n\n\nReal-World Repair Success Stories\nCase Study: Control Board Replacement Saves Expensive Range\nA family with a Frigidaire Gallery Series electric range experienced frequent shutoffs, error codes, and an unresponsive touchpad. Assuming these symptoms meant the end for their appliance, they were preparing to purchase a replacement. However, professional diagnosis identified a failing electronic control board as the sole issue.\nA certified technician replaced just this component—a repair costing significantly less than a new range. The appliance returned to perfect working condition, saving the family considerable expense and the inconvenience of selecting and installing a new range.\nCase Study: The Importance of Proper Diagnosis\nAfter replacing the igniter in their gas oven based on internet advice, a homeowner was frustrated when heating problems persisted. Professional diagnosis revealed that while the new igniter was working correctly, the gas safety valve wasn't opening fully due to an electrical issue in the control system.\nThis case highlights the value of accurate professional diagnosis—identifying the actual cause rather than just addressing symptoms based on common problems.\nPreventative Maintenance for Your Frigidaire Range\nRegular appliance maintenance significantly extends your range's lifespan and prevents many common issues.\nFor Electric Ranges:\n\n\nKeep surface elements clean from food buildup\n\n\nCheck for loose connections at element receptacles\n\n\nClean the oven interior regularly to prevent residue from burning onto elements\n\n\nVerify that drip pans are clean and properly positioned\n\n\nFor Gas Ranges:\n\n\nClean burner caps and ports regularly to ensure proper gas flow\n\n\nInspect igniter electrodes for food debris or misalignment\n\n\nCheck for loose gas connections (if you smell gas, call for service immediately)\n\n\nEnsure burner grates sit properly on the cooktop\n\n\nGeneral Maintenance:\n\n\nWipe up spills promptly to prevent baked-on residue\n\n\nClean control knobs and panels with appropriate non-abrasive cleaners\n\n\nCheck door gaskets for tears or gaps that might affect oven efficiency\n\n\nFollow manufacturer guidelines for self-cleaning functions to avoid component stress\n\n\nWhen Professional Frigidaire Range Repair Is Necessary\nWhile some maintenance is DIY-friendly, certain situations require professional range repair expertise:\n\n\nGas-Related Issues: Any problem involving gas connections or persistent gas odors\n\n\nElectrical Repairs: Internal wiring problems or electronic control failures\n\n\nCalibration Needs: Precise temperature adjustment requires specialized tools\n\n\nPersistent Problems: Issues that continue after basic troubleshooting\n\n\nComponent Replacement: Many internal parts require technical knowledge for proper installation\n\n\nSafety Priority: Always disconnect power before attempting electric range inspections.

        "content": "Frigidaire Range Repair: Expert Solutions for Common Problems Is your Frigidaire range not heating correctly? Are the burners failing to ignite? Or perhaps the control panel is unresponsive? These common issues can disrupt your cooking routine, but understanding their causes can help you determine whether simple maintenance, DIY repairs, or professional service is your best next step. Our comprehensive guide combines technical expertise with practical solutions to address the most frequent Frigidaire range problems.\nUnderstanding Your Frigidaire Range Components\nEvery Frigidaire range, whether gas or electric, combines several key systems that work together to deliver reliable cooking performance. Electric models use precision heating elements for both cooktop and oven functions, while gas models employ a network of valves, igniters, and burners to create and control cooking heat. The control system—which may be simple knobs or a sophisticated digital interface—acts as the command center for all functions.\nWith regular maintenance and timely repairs when issues arise, your Frigidaire range can provide many years of dependable service for all your cooking needs.\nTroubleshooting Electric Frigidaire Range Problems\nSurface Burner Issues\nWhen electric cooktop elements fail to heat properly, the problem usually stems from one of these common causes:\n\n\nDamaged Heating Element: After years of use, elements can develop weak spots, breaks, or visible damage that affects their performance\n\n\nFaulty Burner Receptacle: The socket that connects the element to the range's electrical system can deteriorate from heat cycling\n\n\nConnection Problems: Loose or corroded connections between components can cause intermittent heating\n\n\nControl Switch Failure: The switch that regulates power to the element may be malfunctioning\n\n\nHow to Check: Carefully swap a problematic burner with one you know works well.

These common issues can disrupt your cooking routine, but understanding their causes can help you determine whether simple maintenance, DIY repairs, or professional service is your best next step. Our comprehensive guide combines technical expertise with practical solutions to address the most frequent Frigidaire range problems. \\n\\n## Understanding Your Frigidaire Range Components \\n\\nEvery Frigidaire range, whether gas or electric, combines several key systems that work together to deliver reliable cooking performance. Electric models use precision heating elements for both cooktop and oven functions, while gas models employ a network of valves, igniters, and burners to create and control cooking heat. The control system—which may be simple knobs or a sophisticated digital interface—acts as the command center for all functions. \\n\\nWith regular maintenance and timely repairs when issues arise, your Frigidaire range can provide many years of dependable service for all your cooking needs. \\n\\n## Troubleshooting Electric Frigidaire Range Problems \\n\\n### Surface Burner Issues \\n\\nWhen electric cooktop elements fail to heat properly, the problem usually stems from one of these common causes: \\n\\n- **Damaged Heating Element**: After years of use, elements can develop weak spots, breaks, or visible damage that affects their performance \\n\\n- **Faulty Burner Receptacle**: The socket that connects the element to the range's electrical system can deteriorate from heat cycling \\n\\n- **Connection Problems**: Loose or corroded connections between components can cause intermittent heating \\n\\n- **Control Switch Failure**: The switch that regulates power to the element may be malfunctioning \\n\\n**How to Check**: Carefully swap a problematic burner with one you know works well. If the problem moves with the element, you need a replacement element. If the problem stays in the same location, the receptacle or wiring likely needs attention. \\n\\n### Oven Not Heating Correctly \\n\\nWhen your Frigidaire electric oven fails to heat properly, check for these common culprits: \\n\\n- **Failed Bake Element**: Look for visible damage like blisters, breaks, or discoloration on the element at the oven bottom \\n\\n- **Defective Broil Element**: The upper element may have failed, affecting overall heating and broiling function \\n\\n- **Temperature Sensor Problems**: A faulty sensor can cause inaccurate temperature regulation \\n\\n- **Control Board Issues**: The electronic \\\"brain\\\" of the oven may be malfunctioning, causing heating inconsistencies \\n\\n**Visual Inspection Tip**: With the oven cool and power disconnected, examine the bake element for visible breaks or blistering. Damage usually indicates the element needs replacement. \\n\\nWhen you’re unable to find and resolve a range problem on your own, schedule [stove repair](/repair/range-repair-service) and we’ll send a Sears Home Services technician to your home to fix the problem for you. \\n\\n## Diagnosing Gas Frigidaire Range Problems \\n\\n### Cooktop Burner Difficulties \\n\\nGas burners that won't light or heat inconsistently typically point to these issues: \\n\\n- **Igniter Failure**: The spark igniter may be cracked, misaligned, or electrically faulty \\n\\n- **Clogged Burner Ports**: Food spillover can block gas flow through the burner openings \\n\\n- **Gas Supply Problems**: Verify the gas valve is fully open and supplying all burners \\n\\n- **Control Valve Issues**: The valve regulating gas flow to the burner may be malfunctioning \\n\\n**Safety First**: If you smell gas, immediately turn off the gas supply valve, avoid creating sparks or flames, ventilate the area, and call for professional service. \\n\\n### Oven Heating Failures \\n\\nGas oven problems usually involve these components: \\n\\n- **Weak or Failed Igniter**: The \\\"glow bar\\\" igniter must get hot enough to open the safety valve; as igniters age, they may glow but not reach sufficient temperature \\n\\n- **Gas Safety Valve Problems**: The valve controlling gas flow to the oven burner may be stuck or failing \\n\\n- **Faulty Temperature Regulation**: Issues with the thermostat or temperature sensor can cause inconsistent heating \\n\\n- **Control Module Failures**: Electronic controls can malfunction, affecting all oven functions \\n\\n**Key Symptom**: If your igniter glows for more than 90 seconds without lighting the burner, it's likely too weak to open the safety valve and needs replacement. \\n\\nWhen you’re unable to resolve an oven heating problem on your own, schedule [Frigidaire range repair](/repair/frigidaire) service and we’ll send a technician to your home to fix the oven. \\n\\n## Electronic Control and Display Problems \\n\\nModern Frigidaire ranges often feature sophisticated control systems that can experience unique issues: \\n\\n- **Unresponsive Touchpads**: Control panels may stop responding to touch or button presses \\n\\n- **Error Code Displays**: Digital screens may show specific error codes indicating particular failures \\n\\n- **Erratic Operation**: Ranges may turn on/off unexpectedly or change settings without input \\n\\n- **Power Issues**: Control boards can be affected by power surges or internal component failures \\n\\n**Quick Fix Attempt**: For many electronic issues, resetting the range can help. Disconnect power for 1-2 minutes by unplugging the range or turning off the circuit breaker, then restore power. \\n\\nFor smart-enabled Frigidaire ranges, connectivity problems may involve: \\n\\n- WiFi module malfunction \\n\\n- Home network configuration issues \\n\\n- Software or firmware that needs updating \\n\\n- Account or app synchronization problems \\n\\n## Real-World Repair Success Stories \\n\\n### Case Study: Control Board Replacement Saves Expensive Range \\n\\nA family with a Frigidaire Gallery Series electric range experienced frequent shutoffs, error codes, and an unresponsive touchpad. Assuming these symptoms meant the end for their appliance, they were preparing to purchase a replacement. However, professional diagnosis identified a failing electronic control board as the sole issue. \\n\\nA certified technician replaced just this component—a repair costing significantly less than a new range. The appliance returned to perfect working condition, saving the family considerable expense and the inconvenience of selecting and installing a new range. \\n\\n### Case Study: The Importance of Proper Diagnosis \\n\\nAfter replacing the igniter in their gas oven based on internet advice, a homeowner was frustrated when heating problems persisted. Professional diagnosis revealed that while the new igniter was working correctly, the gas safety valve wasn't opening fully due to an electrical issue in the control system. \\n\\nThis case highlights the value of accurate professional diagnosis—identifying the actual cause rather than just addressing symptoms based on common problems. \\n\\n### Preventative Maintenance for Your Frigidaire Range \\n\\nRegular [appliance maintenance](/maintain/appliance-maintenance) significantly extends your range's lifespan and prevents many common issues. \\n\\n### For Electric Ranges: \\n\\n- Keep surface elements clean from food buildup \\n\\n- Check for loose connections at element receptacles \\n\\n- Clean the oven interior regularly to prevent residue from burning onto elements \\n\\n- Verify that drip pans are clean and properly positioned \\n\\n### For Gas Ranges: \\n\\n- Clean burner caps and ports regularly to ensure proper gas flow \\n\\n- Inspect igniter electrodes for food debris or misalignment \\n\\n- Check for loose gas connections (if you smell gas, call for service immediately) \\n\\n- Ensure burner grates sit properly on the cooktop \\n\\n### General Maintenance: \\n\\n- Wipe up spills promptly to prevent baked-on residue \\n\\n- Clean control knobs and panels with appropriate non-abrasive cleaners \\n\\n- Check door gaskets for tears or gaps that might affect oven efficiency \\n\\n- Follow manufacturer guidelines for self-cleaning functions to avoid component stress \\n\\n## When Professional Frigidaire Range Repair Is Necessary \\n\\nWhile some maintenance is DIY-friendly, certain situations require professional range repair expertise: \\n\\n- **Gas-Related Issues**: Any problem involving gas connections or persistent gas odors \\n\\n- **Electrical Repairs**: Internal wiring problems or electronic control failures \\n\\n- **Calibration Needs**: Precise temperature adjustment requires specialized tools \\n\\n- **Persistent Problems**: Issues that continue after basic troubleshooting \\n\\n- **Component Replacement**: Many internal parts require technical knowledge for proper installation \\n\\n**Safety Priority**: Always disconnect power before attempting electric range inspections.

Safety should always be your highest priority when fixing appliances—even if you need to have someone repair your oven for you.\\n\\nEven if you're sure that you'll have an appliance technician complete the oven repair, it doesn’t hurt to understand the troubleshooting and repair process involved in fixing a gas oven that won’t heat. There's a chance that you can follow some of the troubleshooting steps described below and safely fix the oven yourself.\\n\\nIf you want some practical troubleshooting advice to see if you can fix a non-heating gas oven yourself, you're in the right place. Carefully follow the troubleshooting and diagnostic advice described below to repair a gas oven that isn't heating.\\n\\n## Basic Troubleshooting Steps To Fix a Gas Oven That Won’t Heat\\n\\nWhen troubleshooting any appliance failure, start with the basics. Sometimes a simple fix does the trick.\\n\\n### Check the Gas Supply\\n\\nJust about anyone can follow these basic tips to check the gas supply going to the range or wall oven:\\n\\n* If you’re troubleshooting the oven on a gas range, turn on a surface burner to see if it’s getting gas. If a surface burner works, then you know that your oven should be getting gas as well.\\n* If the surface burner doesn’t work, check the gas supply cut-off valve for your stove to make sure that it's open. \\n* If you’re troubleshooting a wall oven, check to see if the broil burner gets gas and heats up (if your wall oven has a separate broil burner). If you have a double oven, you can check to see if the 2nd oven is heating. If other burners in a wall oven are heating, then you know that the inoperative oven burner should be getting gas as well.\\n* If no burners in your wall oven are heating, check the gas supply cut-off valve for the oven to make sure that it’s open.\\n* If gas supply valve for your stove or wall oven is open and you’re not getting gas to the appliance, check other gas appliances in your home such as the gas dryer. If your entire home is without gas, check the main gas cut-off valve for your house. Open the main cut-off valve if it’s shut. This may restore gas to your oven and other appliances so they work properly.\\n\\nIf the main gas cut-off valve for your home is open and no appliances are getting gas, then you need to contact your gas supplier to figure out what’s wrong.\\n\\nIf other appliances are getting gas but you suspect that your wall oven or stove isn’t getting gas, then you’ll likely need to have a plumber or gas technician from your gas supplier fix the gas supply going to your stove or wall oven.\\n\\n### Check the Service Cut-Off Valve\\n\\nMany gas ranges have a service cut-off valve on their pressure regulator at the back of the stove. It shuts off the gas supply to the oven but not the surface burners. \\n\\nIf the surface burners on your gas stove work but the oven burners aren’t getting gas, make sure that the lever on the service cut-off valve is in the open position.\\n\\n![Checking the service cut-off valve](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/3sUOqIPGTYVRNvsIYQHlov/4b8cffc6edcafbfed88dfb940a91afd0/Check_the_service_cut-off_valve.png)\\n\\n## Advanced Troubleshooting For a Gas Oven That Won’t Heat\\n\\nWhen the basic troubleshooting steps don’t do the trick, you’ll need to conduct some advanced troubleshooting to fix a gas oven that isn’t heating. Nothing’s better than a YouTube video to describe advanced troubleshooting for a non-heating gas oven. Follow the steps in this Sears PartsDirect YouTube video to fix your gas oven:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iuRrcw6y7Dc\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nAfter the video goes through some of the basic troubleshooting steps described above, the following diagnostic techniques are used to figure out what’s wrong with a gas oven that won’t heat.\\n\\n### Test the Oven Igniter\\n\\nMost gas ovens use a glow bar ignition system that uses this ignition process:\\n\\n1. The control sends electrical current through the igniter and safety gas valve to light the oven burner and heat the oven.\\n2. The igniter heats up but the safety gas valve won't open to ignite the burner until the igniter reaches a safe ignition temperature.\\n3. As the igniter heats up, the resistance of the igniter element decreases and more current flows through the circuit to the safety gas valve.\\n4. When the igniter reaches ignition temperature, its resistance is low enough to allow enough current to flow through the circuit and open the safety gas valve.\\n5. Gas flows through the open valve and to the burner and ignites.\\n\\nThe number 1 failure preventing a gas oven from heating is a weak igniter. The igniter won’t get hot enough to allow adequate current to flow to the safety valve so the valve won’t open to let gas flow to the burner for ignition.\\n\\nThat’s why we recommend testing the oven igniter first.\\n\\nPull the bottom panel out of your cold oven. Start the oven and see if the igniter glows.\\n\\nIf the igniter glows but the burner doesn’t ignite because the gas valve doesn’t open, then you’ll likely need to replace the igniter. As noted in the video, if you're uncertain whether your glowing igniter has failed, you can [schedule service for your oven](/repair/oven-repair-service) and have a Sears service technician check the amp draw through the igniter circuit.\\n\\nIf you’re convinced that the oven igniter is bad, then you can [order a new igniter](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/category/1234574/range-parts) and replace the igniter. Replacing a gas oven igniter is a relatively safe repair that most DIY’ers can accomplish on their own because it doesn’t involve disconnecting any gas lines in the oven. Follow the steps in this YouTube video to replace the oven igniter:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DTXwfTiFZfE\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nNow, if the igniter __doesn’t__ glow, then the igniter element may be broken. You’ll need a [multimeter](https://www.sears.com/craftsman-multimeter-digital-with-8-functions-and-20/p-03482141000P) to check resistance through the igniter so see if the element is bad.\\n\\nUnplug the range. For safety, always disconnect power before checking resistance. To check the resistance of the igniter, put the meter leads on the igniter terminals. If you measure between 10 and 2,500 ohms, then you know your igniter is okay.\\n\\nIf the igniter measures no continuity, then you need to replace the igniter.\\n\\n## Test the Safety Gas Valve\\n\\nNext, check resistance through the safety gas valve. The meter should measure less than 5 ohms of resistance through the terminals on the safety gas valve. \\n\\nIf the safety gas valve measures no continuity, you can [have a Sears technician replace that part](/repair/range-repair-service). Replacing the safety gas valve involve disconnection of gas lines inside the oven.\\n\\n## Check the Wiring and Control Board\\n\\nWhen you find that the igniter and safety gas valve appear to be okay, you’ll need to check wiring in the ignition circuit and the electronic oven control board. \\n\\nWith electrical power still disconnected from the oven, access the back of the electronic oven control board and check resistance through the ignition circuit wires connected to the electronic control board. \\n\\nIf you measure the same resistance through the ignition circuit as you measured through the igniter (between 10 and 2,500 ohms), then replace the electronic control board because you know that the wiring through the ignition circuit is okay.\\n\\nIf you measure infinite resistance (also called an open load) through the ignition circuit wiring, then you'll need to trace the wires through the ignition circuit and repair the broken wire (with the oven still disconnected from electrical power).\\n\\nThese DIY troubleshooting steps should help you fix a gas oven that isn’t heating in most situations. If you can’t figure out what’s wrong and fix the oven on your own, don’t hesitate to [schedule oven repair service](/repair/oven-repair-service) and we’ll send a Sears Tech right out to your home to fix the oven.\"])",

These ranges are popular for their ease of use, steady heat control, and fewer safety risks compared to gas appliances.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![electric-range-components](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/4I5uGYoLWhlJ9z8UbAhgn7/2c98d4e9ce3b25988c717f4f74f2b30c/electric-range-components.png)\\n\\n## Core Components of an Electric Range\\n\\nTo understand how an electric range works, let’s first look at its key components:\\n\\n* __Heating Elements:__ Electric ranges have two types of heating elements—one for the stovetop and one for the oven. Heating elements work by sending a stream of electrical current through a high-resistance wire that heats up as electrons collide with current-resistant metal.\\n* __Stovetop Burners:__ Coils elements or radiant surface elements for a ceramic glass top ranges heat up to provide direct heat for pots and pans.\\n* __Oven Heating Elements:__ Usually located at the top and bottom of the oven, these elements create the temperature needed for baking and roasting.\\n* __Surface Burner Control Switches:__ Also known as burner infinite switches, these components control the heat level of stovetop burners.\\n* __Electronic Oven Control Board:__ This circuit board governs oven operations including the bake mode, broil mode and self-cleaning mode.\\n* __Oven Temperature Sensor:__ This device senses oven temperature and sends that signal to the electronic oven control board to accurately control oven temperature.\\n* __Control Panel:__ Houses oven and stovetop controls that allow you to adjust the oven temperature, timer, and control surface elements.\\n* __Electrical Wiring:__ Powers the heating elements and controls, allowing electricity to flow through the appliance safely.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How Electric Stovetop Burners Work\\n\\nWhen you turn on an electric stovetop burner, a few steps occur to generate heat:\\n\\n__Step 1:__ Turning burner control knob on the control panel allows electricity to flow to the coil or ceramic element.\\n__Step 2:__ The heating element’s resistance to the electricity causes it to heat up. This principle, known as Joule heating, is the same process that warms up an electric space heater.\\n__Step 3:__ The stovetop burner will continue to heat up until it reaches the desired temperature, and then the control switch maintains that temperature by cycling the element on and off.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How the Electric Oven Works\\n\\nThe electric oven functions in much the same way as the stovetop but involves more complex temperature control to ensure consistent cooking.\\n\\n__Step 1:__ When you set the oven to a specific temperature, electricity flows to the oven’s heating elements (usually at the top and bottom).\\n__Step 2:__ These elements warm up and distribute heat evenly across the oven interior.\\n__Step 3:__ The oven’s temperature constantly monitors the oven cavity temperature, cycling the heating elements on and off to keep it consistent.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![setting-electric-oven-controls](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/2dy1dPivjv8LU5mYZhiJS7/98633129d34e020c49106923e6c1b8ab/setting-electric-oven-controls.png)\\n\\n## Oven Heating Options:\\n\\n* __Bake Setting:__ Activates the bottom heating element, making it ideal for baking.\\n* __Broil Setting:__ Activates the top heating element, providing direct heat from above for browning and finishing dishes.\\n* __Convection Option (if available):__ A fan circulates hot air, offering more uniform cooking and quicker results.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Advantages of Electric Ranges\\n\\nElectric ranges have several benefits:\\n\\n* __Steady, Even Heat:__ Electric burners heat consistently, allowing for precise cooking.\\n* __Ease of Installation:__ Most homes are equipped with electrical outlets, while gas lines are less common.\\n* __Low Maintenance:__ Electric ranges have fewer parts and are easier to clean, especially with smooth-top surfaces.\\n* __Safety:__ No open flame reduces fire risks and eliminates the need for ventilation.\\n* __Rebates:__ Using an electric range helps the environment when compared to a gas range, so you can soon get up to an $840 rebate for switching from a gas to electric range under the [HEEHRA](/blog/what-is-heehra) electrification provisions of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act passed by the U.S. Congress.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![cleaning-a-glass-electric-stovetop](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/5USJvVWBolEh0zTuLPhsUi/f7fc2a4747eba616db27c28c07e9ae9c/cleaning-a-glass-electric-stovetop.png)\\n\\n## Maintenance Tips for Electric Ranges\\n\\nTo keep your electric range working efficiently and safely, consider these maintenance tips:\\n\\n* __Clean Regularly:__ Wipe down the stovetop after each use, and regularly clean oven spills to prevent buildup.\\n* __Inspect Heating Elements:__ Check for visible damage, like cracks or worn-out coils, and replace if necessary.\\n* __Use Correct Cookware:__ Ensure the cookware is flat-bottomed and appropriate for electric burners.\\n* __Professional Maintenance:__ Schedule annual [range maintenance](/maintain) to have a professional inspect the wiring, controls and components to ensure the stove stays in good condition. Immediately schedule [range repair](/repair/range-repair-service) if you notice any issues or failures.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Troubleshooting Common Electric Range Issues\\n\\nIf your electric range isn’t functioning correctly, these DIY troubleshooting tips might help.\\n\\n### Oven Won’t Heat\\n\\nAn inadequate power supply, wiring failure, bad bake element, defective temperature sensor or failed electronic control board all could all prevent an electric oven from heating.

If your home uses house fuses, reinstall the house fuses for the stove to restore power.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What To Do When the Coil Element Doesn’t Heat\\n\\nWhen a coil surface element doesn’t heat, the failure causing the problem isn’t always a bad element. Here’s a DIY repair video that shows how to diagnose and fix a problem with a coil surface element not heating.\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eLZcldj0J3k\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Sears Home Services Can Replace a Burnt Out Stove Element When You Have a Glass Top Range\\n\\nWhen your stove has a ceramic glass top, schedule [range repair near you](/repair/range-repair-service) with a Sears Home Services Technician to replace the burnt out stove element. Our technicians are factory trained on most major brands and are qualified for [LG stove repair](/repair/lg/range), [Maytag stove repair](/repair/maytag/range), [Whirlpool range repair](/repair/whirlpool/range), and more. Safely lifting the glass top and replacing a radiant surface element is a challenge for most appliance repair DIY’ers. \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Keep Your Stove in Top Shape With Annual Professional Maintenance by Sears Home Services\\n\\nDepend on Sears Home Services to help you keep your stove in top shape with by [scheduling annual stove maintenance checks](/maintain). Our technician will perform the following services during the visit:\\n\\n* __Check control operation.__  Range controls are checked for accurate temperature control of the oven and stovetop burners. Faulty controls can cause the range to waste energy when overheating occurs.\\n* __Examine oven door alignment and clean the oven door gasket.__ A loose door gasket or bent door hinges can prevent the oven door from sealing, allowing heat to escape during baking. You’ll wind up paying higher energy bills because the burner ignites more often and stays burning longer to heat the oven. The technician adjusts and cleans the oven door gasket to make sure it seals the oven door properly.\\n* __Test oven self-cleaning operation.__ On ranges that have self-cleaning ovens, the service technician checks the control and oven door lock to make sure it stays closed during the self-cleaning cycle. During the self-cleaning operation, oven heats to extremely high temperatures to burn spills and residue inside the oven to ash. To prevent fires, the oven door must remain closed and locked during self-cleaning. If you were to open the door during self-cleaning, a sudden rush of air into the extremely hot oven can cause a serious fire. \\n* __Check and clean the stovetop burners.__ The technician cleans and checks electric elements to make sure they’re operating properly and safely. A short circuit in an electric stovetop burner can cause a serious electrocution risk. An element on a glass-top range that overheats can damage the glass top. On a gas range, the technician cleans checks and adjusts the surface burners. A dirty surface burner can fail to ignite – posing a serious safety risk. \\n* __Check oven burners or elements.__ The technician examines and adjusts oven burners in a gas range or electric elements in an electric range. Gas oven burners that aren’t adjusted correctly can fail to heat the oven properly and may emit excessive carbon monoxide. Electric elements that aren’t heating correctly will fail to heat the oven properly. A shorted electric element also can pose a serious electrocution risk.\\n* __Inspect readily accessible electrical wiring.__ The technician will check the wiring on gas and electric ranges, for insulation damage, proper grounding and secure connections. Damaged wiring or wiring that’s not secure can cause an electrocution risk. The ground connection dissipates an electrical short to prevent you from getting an electric shock if a loose wire touches metal in the range. \\n* __Level the range and check the anti-tip device.__ The technician levels the range to reduce the risk that a pot or pan will accidentally slide off a gas surface burner. Leveling also helps items bake properly in the oven. The anti-tip device is an essential bracket that prevents the range from tipping forward when you open the oven door and extend an oven rack out of the range with a dish on the rack.\\n\\nHaving your stove professionally cleaned and maintained every year will help keep it operating efficiently and lasting longer.\\n\\nWe can keep all of your home appliances in top shape when you [schedule our Kitchen \\u0026 Laundry Appliance Check-Up](/maintain/kitchen-laundry-appliance-check-up).

When ignited, the gas produces a flame that heats cookware directly. This direct heat offers unmatched control, allowing you to make quick adjustments to temperature, which is why gas stoves are often preferred in many kitchens.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How Does a Gas Stove Work?\\n\\nA gas stove connects to your home’s gas supply through a gas line with a shut-off valve. The incoming gas supply then connects to a pressure regulator that limits gas pressure and flow to design specifications for your stove.\\n\\nFrom the pressure regulator, the gas supply branches out to the cooktop burners and the oven burners. Here are descriptions of those stove systems.\\n\\n### Cooktop Burner System\\n\\nHere’s how the cooktop burner system works in a gas stove:\\n\\n* Gas from the pressure regulator first goes to the cooktop burner control valves. \\n* When you turn on a cooktop burner, gas travels from the control valve to the burner head. \\n* The control valve has an igniter switch that sends current to the spark igniter electrode next to the burner head to ignite the gas when you turn on a cooktop burner. The burner ignites and begins heating.\\n* You can adjust the cooktop burner flame by rotating the burner control valve.\\n* When you’ve finished cooking on the burner, you can shut off the control valve and the burner flame will go out.\\n\\n### How a Gas Oven Works\\n\\n* When you set your desired temperature and turn the control knob on, the thermostat sends electric current to the glow bar igniter to start the oven. If you have an oven with an electronic control panel, the electronic control board will activate a relay and send current to the glow bar ignition system to light the burner.\\n* The igniter heats up and glows to ignite the burner when the safety gas valve opens. For safety, the gas valve in the ignition system won’t open until the glow bar gets hot enough to ignite the gas and allows enough electrical current to flow downstream to the current-activated switch on that device.\\n* As the glow bar igniter heats up, its electrical resistance decreases to allow more current to flow to the safety gas valve. Once the igniter glow bar is so hot that it allows more than 3 amps of current to the safety gas valve switch, the bi-metal switch on the safety gas valve trips. This opens the gas valve and gas flows to the burner tube and ignites.\\n* The glow bar igniter continues to glow as the burner flames heat the oven. When the oven reaches the set temperature, the control shuts off current to the igniter and safety gas valve. The burner shuts off and stays off until oven temperature decreases about 10 degrees below the oven temperature set point. Then the ignition process repeats to light the burner and maintain the set temperature.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Benefits of Cooking with a Gas Stove\\n\\nThe oven and cooktop of a gas stove offer significant advantages over electric ranges.\\n\\n### Benefits of a Gas Stovetop\\n\\n* __Instant Heat:__ Flames appear immediately upon ignition. Fast heating burners save you time when cooking.\\n* __Precise Temperature Control:__ You can quickly increase or decrease surface burner heat by adjusting the knob. A gas burner provides consistent heating because it doesn’t cycle on and off like an electric surface element does when heating.\\n* __Even Heat Distribution:__ Flames wrap around cookware for uniform cooking.\\n* __Cost Efficiency:__ Natural gas and propane is often cheaper than electricity for powering stoves.\\n\\n### Advantages of a Gas Oven\\n\\n* __Quick Preheating:__ Gas ovens heat up faster than electric ovens because they generate heat directly from the flame.\\n* __Moist Baking Environment:__ The combustion process releases moisture, which can help prevent foods from drying out—ideal for baking and roasting.\\n* __Precise Temperature Control:__ Adjusting the oven temperature will result in quicker response in a gas oven. Also, the gas flame provides more immediate and precise heat level adjustments to consistently maintain baking temperature at the chosen setting.\\n* __Cost Efficiency:__ Natural gas and propane is often cheaper than electricity for heating the oven.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Tips for Safe and Efficient Gas Stove Use\\n\\nFollow these expert tips to use your gas stove safely.\\n\\n### Ensure Proper Ventilation\\n\\nGas stoves release combustion byproducts, so make sure your kitchen is well-ventilated. Run the range hood when using the gas stove.\\n\\nKeep the range hood running for a few minutes after you finish cooking or baking to exhaust all combustion fumes out of your kitchen.\\n\\n### Keep Burners Clean Regularly\\n\\nClogged burner nozzles can cause combustion problems and affect flame performance. Follow the procedure shown in this popular YouTube video to thoroughly clean stove top burners:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9m5nF-uvwkI\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n### Turn Off Burners Properly\\n\\nAlways double-check that burners are completely off after cooking.\\n\\n### Check for Leaks\\n\\nPeriodically inspect your gas supply line and connections. \\n\\nUse soapy water to detect leaks—bubbles will form where gas escapes from leaks or loose gas line connections.\\n\\nIf you ever smell gas, turn off the stove immediately, ventilate the area, and contact your local gas company.\\n\\n### Avoid Overcrowding the Oven\\n\\nOvercrowding the oven can block heat circulation, leading to air circulation problems in the oven cavity and uneven cooking.\\n\\nFollow the tips in this helpful YouTube video to position and use oven racks properly:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r_tcl5NCDjo\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n### Professional Maintenance\\n\\nSchedule professional [oven maintenance](/maintain) every year. A qualified service technician will visit your home and perform these essential oven maintenance, inspection and cleaning tasks:\\n\\n* Inspect gas supply connections.\\n* Check the ignition systems.\\n* Inspect surface and oven burners and clean them if needed.\\n* Examine cooktop and oven flames and adjust the flame settings if necessary.\\n* Check the overall cooktop and oven performance.\\n* Inspect readily accessible electrical wiring.\\n* Level the stove if necessary.\\n\\nAnnual professional maintenance won’t just ensure that the stove works safely and efficiently, it will also help your appliance last longer.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Common Gas Stove Problems and Solutions\\n\\n### Cooktop Issues\\n\\n* __Uneven Flame or Yellow Flame:__ Indicates improper gas-to-air ratio. Clean the burner and check for obstructions.\\n* __Burner Not Igniting:__ Check the ignition system and ensure the burner is clean and dry. A surface burner igniter switch and a spark module control the sparking for burners. A power supply problem, failed igniter switch, bad spark module or wiring failure in the spark ignition circuit can prevent the electrodes from sparking.\\n\\n### Gas Oven Problems\\n\\nFollow these expert troubleshooting tips when you encounter problems with your gas stove’s oven.\\n\\n#### Gas Oven Won’t Heat\\n\\nSeveral different problems can prevent the oven in your gas stove from heating. Follow the tips in this popular YouTube DIY video to fix an oven heating problem in your gas stove:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iuRrcw6y7Dc\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nIf you’re unable to find and fix the oven heating problem yourself, schedule [range repair](/repair/range-repair-service) service and we’ll send a Sears Home Services technician to your home to resolve the issue.\\n\\n#### Oven Temperature is Wrong\\n\\nIf the oven isn't heating to the baking temperature you set — it's too hot or not hot enough — the oven temperature sensor could be malfunctioning. Or the problem could be with the electronic oven control board, which controls oven functions.\\n\\nYou can test the oven temperature sensor probe by unplugging the range and measuring sensor probe resistance using a multimeter. It should measure about 1,080 ohms of resistance through most probes at room temperature.\\n\\nRefer to the tech sheet for the probe's resistance specification for your range. You can likely find the tech sheet in the control console or taped to the back of the range. Replace the oven temperature sensor probe if the multimeter doesn't measure the correct resistance through the probe.

Understanding with these systems improves cooking performance and helps you maintain the stove.\\\",\\\"keyTakeaway2\\\":\\\"Gas stoves offer distinct benefits, such as instant heat, precise temperature control, and even heat distribution. Gas ovens also provide faster preheating and a moist baking environment, which is ideal for some dishes. Additionally, the cost efficiency of using natural gas or propane is a significant advantage over electric appliances in many areas. \\\",\\\"keyTakeaway3\\\":\\\"Regular cleaning of burners, ensuring proper ventilation, and checking for gas leaks are crucial for safe gas stove operation. Professional maintenance, such as inspecting connections and ignition systems, helps ensure long-term efficiency and safety. \\\",\\\"information\\\":\\\"$21\\\",\\\"secondaryClassification\\\":\\\"APPLIANCE 101\\\",\\\"faqQuestion1\\\":\\\"How is heat generated in a gas stove?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer1\\\":\\\"A gas stove ignites a controlled flow of natural or propane gas, producing a flame beneath the burner cap. Sears Home Services technicians ensure all connections are tight for safety.\\\",\\\"faqQuestion2\\\":\\\"Why does my stove have both a pilot light and electronic ignition?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer2\\\":\\\"Some models use a standing pilot while others use spark ignition. Sears Home Services can service both systems if issues arise.\\\",\\\"faqQuestion3\\\":\\\"Are gas stoves energy-efficient?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer3\\\":\\\"They often heat faster and may be cheaper to run compared to electric, depending on local utility costs.
