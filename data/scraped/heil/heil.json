Follow the DIY troubleshooting tips in these videos to restore proper cooling in your refrigerator:\\n\\n* [Troubleshooting a refrigerator not cooling video](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/article/troubleshooting-a-refrigerator-not-cooling-video)\\n* [Diagnosing refrigerator evaporator fan problems video](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/article/diagnosing-refrigerator-evaporator-fan-problems-video)\\n* [Diagnosing refrigerator thermistor problems video](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/article/diagnosing-refrigerator-thermistor-problems-video)\\n* [Troubleshooting defrost system problems video](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/article/refrigerator-wont-cool-troubleshooting-video-defrost-system-problems)\\n\\nThese expert tips may help you fix the refrigerator cooling problem. If not, [schedule refrigerator repair service](/repair/refrigerator-repair-service) and we’ll send a Sears Technician to your home to fix the fridge.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Won’t Power Up\\n\\nWhen you find the fridge completely dead, check the control to make sure the fridge is turned on. If that doesn’t fix the problem, check the house circuit breaker for your fridge. Reset the circuit breaker in case it has tripped.\\n\\nIf the fridge won’t power up after resetting the house circuit breaker, check the electrical outlet. Make sure the refrigerator outlet cord is securely plugged in. \\n\\nIf the outlet cord is plugged in, test the electrical outlet by plugging in a lamp or other small appliance to verify that the outlet is working.\\n\\nIf the outlet has no power, have an electrician fix the outlet.\\n\\nIf the outlet works, check the refrigerator power cord for damage. Replace the power cord if you find damage.\\n\\nIf the outlet cord is good, then a failed electronic control board or bad control panel could be causing the problem. These parts are expensive. You’ll likely need to [have a service technician diagnose and repair the fridge](/repair) if basic troubleshooting doesn’t help you find the cause of the failure.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Excessive Frost in the Freezer\\n\\nWhen snowy frost coats items in the freezer, check for loose spots or damage in the door gaskets that could be letting in warm, moist air. That moist air will cause the excessive frost in the freezer compartment.\\n\\nYou may be able to fix the problem by pushing a loose door gasket back into its channel.

Check to see if the ice dispenser door closes properly. Remove a stuck ice cube if that’s what you find keeping the door from closing. Replace the ice dispenser door flap if it’s damaged or broken.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Ice Maker Not Working\\n\\n Several problems can prevent ice production in the freezer or ice compartment. The ice maker could be jammed or broken, a dirty water filter or kinked water line could be blocking water flow or the water inlet valve could be clogged or faulty. A control board problem can also kill ice production.\\n\\nBecause many ice makers are controlled by electronic circuit boards, you can sometimes fix the problem by shutting off the ice maker then turning it back on. If that doesn’t fix the ice maker, disconnect power to the entire fridge for several minutes to reset all circuit boards in the refrigerator. Power the refrigerator back up and see if the ice maker works. If it does, then you’ve likely fixed the problem.\\n\\nIf this initial repair tip didn’t fix the ice maker, try these additional troubleshooting steps:\\n\\n* Check the ice maker for jammed cubes and clear any ice buildup that you find.\\n* See if the refrigerator water dispenser works. If not, replace the water filter. If that doesn’t help restore water flow, then you’ll likely need to [replace the water valve](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/repair-guide/how-to-replace-the-water-inlet-valve-in-a-top-freezer-refrigerator) if it's clogged or won't fill the ice maker when activated. \\n* No ice in the ice maker also could mean that your refrigerator isn't cooling-the ice maker won't cycle if the freezer is warmer than 5 degrees F. Check freezer temperature and fix the cooling problem if the freezer isn’t cooling properly.\\n\\nIf these troubleshooting steps don’t help you fix the ice maker, you’ll likely need to [have a service technician diagnose and repair the failure](/repair).\\n\\n---\\n\\n![Image of woman viewing refrigerator error code](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/tCi9c00N5eiW1t5ahEenu/9e301e1288e76ec3d9d8c43276dae716/Image_of_woman_viewing_refrigerator_error_code.jpg)\\n\\n## Refrigerator Displays an Error Code\\n\\nMany refrigerators have an electronic control board that detect failures for you and display and error code on the control panel. You can quickly figure out what’s wrong with this type of fridge—as long as you can crack the code. \\n\\nWhen you see a code displayed on the control panel of your refrigerator, use our [Refrigerator Error Code Charts](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/error-codes/refrigerator-repair/1234589) to determine the cause of the code and get DIY troubleshooting tips to fix your fridge.\\n\\nAt some point, you may find that you’re unable to complete the error code troubleshooting, or you’re unable to determine the cause of the failure after following the repair steps listed for an error code. In that situation, you’ll likely need to have a service technician diagnose and repair your fridge.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## When to Replace Your Fridge Instead of Repairing It\\n\\nWhen your refrigerator is over 10 years old and a repair is going to cost you half as much as buying a new fridge, then it’s typically time to replace the refrigerator instead of repairing it.\\n\\n![Upgrade You Appliances Image](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/29MiEr9HvIZJDc3QyipZ3Z/1adb7ce2ad6e29187f35920f2612929b/Upgrade_You_Appliances_Image.png)\\n\\nWhen the time comes to replace your fridge, or all of your kitchen appliances, [visit our Sears.com website](https://www.sears.com) to easily select the products you need and get help with financing.\\n\\nEfficient and durable appliances help make a house a home.

Windows are designed to maximize energy savings by minimizing air leakage and improving thermal performance. Low-emissivity (low-E) coatings are often applied to the glass, reflecting heat back into the room during winter and blocking solar heat gain during summer. Additionally, advanced weatherstripping and sealing techniques ensure a tight seal, preventing air infiltration and boosting overall energy efficiency.\\n\\nWith these advancements in glass technology, improved insulation capabilities, and energy-efficient features, windows in 2026 are truly better than ever. They not only enhance the aesthetics of your home but also provide superior performance, energy savings, and comfort. If you're wondering if it's time to replace your windows, now is the perfect time to take advantage of the latest innovations in window technology.\\n\\n![window improvements](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/13w445EKteJCDygFQ6mTLa/efde1b9a7f3b31992566149202e1210e/window_improvements.jpg)\\n\\n## Boosting Home Security with Modern Windows\\n\\nWindows play a crucial role in home security, and thanks to technological advancements, they now offer enhanced protection for your home.\\n\\nOne of the latest security features in windows is the use of impact-resistant materials. These materials can withstand the force of potential break-ins, ensuring that intruders have a hard time gaining access to your home. Investing in windows made from impact-resistant materials provides peace of mind, knowing your home is secure.\\n\\nApart from impact-resistant materials, advanced locking mechanisms are another key aspect of enhanced home security. Modern windows come equipped with state-of-the-art locking systems that provide an extra layer of protection. These locks are designed to be tamper-proof and difficult to pick, making it extremely challenging for intruders to break into your home through the windows.\\n\\nChoosing windows with the latest security features significantly enhances the safety of your home. These windows not only protect against potential break-ins but also deter criminals from attempting to enter your property. Understanding windows with security features can help you choose the right windows for your home, ensuring your family and belongings are well-protected.\\n\\n## Improved Noise Reduction: The Key to a Peaceful Home\\n\\nNoise reduction is a critical consideration when selecting windows for your home. Nobody wants to be disturbed by the sounds of traffic, construction, or noisy neighbors. That's why modern windows are designed with improved noise reduction technology to provide a quieter and more peaceful living environment.\\n\\nOne of the key features contributing to enhanced noise reduction is soundproofing technology. This technology uses specialized materials and construction techniques to minimize sound transmission through the windows. By blocking out external noise, soundproof windows create a serene indoor atmosphere where you can relax and enjoy your surroundings without distractions.\\n\\nDouble or triple pane windows also significantly improve noise reduction. These windows consist of multiple layers of glass with insulating gas in between, creating an extra barrier against sound infiltration. The additional layers and gas fill help to absorb and dampen sound waves, resulting in a quieter interior.\\n\\nTo determine the effectiveness of windows in reducing noise, refer to their noise reduction ratings. This rating, often expressed in decibels (dB), indicates how much sound the windows can block. The higher the noise reduction rating, the better the windows are at reducing noise. Choose windows with high noise reduction ratings for maximum tranquility in your home.\\n\\nTop window replacement contractors offer a wide range of windows that incorporate the latest noise reduction technologies. Choose the best windows for your needs, considering factors such as location, noise levels, and personal preferences. Experience the benefits of improved noise reduction in your home with high-quality windows.\\n\\n## Energy Efficiency: A Top Priority in New Windows\\n\\nFor homeowners, energy efficiency is a top priority when it comes to windows. In 2026, windows are excelling in saving energy and reducing utility costs.

This glass has a special coating that reflects heat back into the room, reducing heat loss through the window. By keeping the heat inside during winter and blocking heat from entering during summer, Low-E glass helps minimize the need for heating and cooling, leading to reduced energy consumption and lower utility bills.\\n- Insulated frames and sashes: Windows with insulated frames and sashes provide enhanced thermal performance. These frames and sashes are designed with materials that have low thermal conductivity, reducing heat transfer between the interior and exterior of the home. By minimizing thermal bridging, insulated frames and sashes help maintain a consistent indoor temperature and decrease the energy required to heat or cool a home.\\n\\nBy investing in windows with energy-saving coatings, Low-E glass, and insulated frames and sashes, homeowners can significantly improve the energy efficiency of their homes. Not only do these advancements lead to lower utility bills, but they also create a more comfortable living environment year-round. Window contractors often offer a wide range of windows that incorporate these energy-efficient features. \\n\\n## Durability: A Key Feature of Replacement Windows\\n\\nDurability is a key consideration when choosing new windows for your home. Thanks to technological advancements, windows now offer superior durability than ever before. Here are three ways in which windows have been enhanced to offer long-lasting performance:\\n\\n1. High-quality window materials: Today's windows are made with top-quality materials designed to be strong, sturdy, and resistant to wear and tear. Be it vinyl, fiberglass, or aluminum windows, you can trust them to stand the test of time.\\n\\n2. Resistance to weather elements: Windows are constantly exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain, wind, and extreme temperatures. The latest windows are engineered to resist these elements, preventing water leaks, drafts, and heat loss. With improved insulation and sealing, these windows provide a barrier against the elements, keeping your home comfortable and protected.\\n\\n3. Long-lasting performance: Investing in high-quality windows means investing in long-lasting performance. Modern windows are built to meet stringent quality standards, ensuring they will continue to function optimally for years to come. With proper maintenance, your windows will maintain their performance and appearance, adding value to your home.\\n\\nIt's crucial understand the importance of durable windows. Most window replacement contractors offer a wide selection of top-quality windows that are built to last. A team of experts from the service provider that you choose can help you select the right windows for your home and ensure professional installation. By making the right decisions on window replacement, you can trust that your windows will stand the test of time.\\n\\n## Improve Your Home's Aesthetics with New Windows\\n\\nWindows play a significant role in enhancing the overall look and feel of your home. Window manufacturers constantly upgrade and improve their products. In 2026, windows are continuing to undergo remarkable transformations, offering sleek and modern designs that seamlessly blend with any architectural style.\\n\\nOne standout feature of modern window designs is their sleekness. With clean lines and minimalist frames, these windows create a contemporary and sophisticated appeal. They provide a seamless transition between the interior and exterior of your home, allowing natural light to flood in while offering unobstructed views of the outside world.\\n\\nMoreover, modern windows offer a wide range of customizable options to suit your specific preferences and needs. Whether you prefer casement, double-hung, or sliding windows, you can find the perfect style that complements your home's architecture. Additionally, you can choose from various glass options, such as frosted or tinted glass, to enhance privacy and energy efficiency.\\n\\nAnother area where modern windows excel is the variety of color choices available. No longer are you limited to traditional white or beige frames. Now, you can select from an extensive palette of colors to match your home's exterior or interior decor. Whether you prefer bold and vibrant hues or subtle and understated shades, there is a color option to suit every taste.\\n\"])",

An HVAC unit is a major home investment, and if something goes wrong, you want to be sure you’re protected.\\n\\nWhether you’re [buying a furnace](/repair/hvac/gas-furnace-repair-service), a new air conditioning unit or a whole-house system, check the warranty, and talk to your contractor or vendor about what you can expect in the HVAC terms of service. Make sure you go with a provider whose coverage supports the level of investment you’re making.\\n\\nWhen reviewing warranties keep the following in mind.\\n\\n## HVAC System Warranty Duration\\n\\nHeating and cooling units can be costly to repair, so you’ll probably want to find the longest-term warranty available. Keep in mind that many HVAC service agreements have varying time frames for different parts. For example, 10 years for parts and 20 years for a heat exchanger is good.\\n\\n## Conditions for Use Covered by the Warranty\\n\\nAll warranties have conditions under which they are valid, which often relate back to who bought the unit. Some are void once the home changes ownership.\\n\\nMany warranties also require the unit to be registered within 90 days of installation to be valid.\\n\\n## Things That Might Invalidate Your Warranty\\n\\nEven a lifetime warranty can be voided if you don’t follow the rules. Many HVAC warranties require proof that the unit has been properly maintained with [routine annual HVAC system maintenance](/maintain/heating-cooling-maintenance) — so make sure to schedule checkups and keep the paperwork somewhere safe.\\n\\nOther warranties may be invalidated on day one if a certified contractor does not install the unit. Before you plan to install it yourself, make sure you read the fine print.\\n\\n## Labor Costs Not Covered by the Warranty\\n\\nEven if you have a lifetime warranty, you may still get stuck with labor costs. Most warranties only cover labor for the first year, though some brands allow you to purchase extended HVAC labor warranties.\\n\\nProtect yourself: The Sears Home Services [Sears Protect Home Warranty Plan](/home-warranty) includes two free HVAC maintenance checks every year.\"])",

Here's what you need to know:\\n\\nThe lifespan of an appliance can vary, but here are some ballpark figures:\\n\\n* Refrigerators: Generally, refrigerators last between 10 to 15 years.\\n* Dishwashers: Dishwashers usually last around 7 to 12 years.\\n* Washing machines: Depending on their usage, washing machines can go strong for 8 to 12 years.\\n* Dryers: Dryers have a similar lifespan to washing machines, lasting approximately 8 to 12 years.\\n* Ovens and ranges: These appliances can last anywhere from 10 to 20 years.\\n\\nSeveral factors can influence the lifespan of your appliances. These include:\\n\\n* Quality of the appliance: Better-quality appliances generally last longer.\\n* Usage and maintenance: Regular maintenance and correct usage can prolong the lifespan of your appliances.\\n* Environmental conditions: Extreme temperatures, humidity, and other environmental elements can affect appliance performance and durability.\\n\\nIf you notice any of the following signs, it might be time to think about replacing your appliance:\\n\\n* Regular breakdowns and repairs.\\n* Subpar performance, such as not cooling or heating efficiently.\\n* Unusual noises or smells.\\n* Outdated technology or lack of energy efficiency.\\n\\nKeep in mind that these are just rough guidelines, and your individual appliance's lifespan may vary. If you're uncertain about whether to repair or replace, don't hesitate to consult with a professional technician who can provide expert advice based on your unique situation.\\n\\n## Repair vs. Replace: The Big Decision\\n\\nIf your appliance isn't working as it should, deciding whether to repair or replace it can be challenging. Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of repairs is a key step in this decision-making process.\\n\\nConsider the appliance's age and condition. Older appliances may be more susceptible to breakdowns and may not be worth repairing, especially if the cost of repairs exceeds the value of the appliance. Also, if the appliance has a history of frequent repairs, it might be more economical to replace it with a newer, more reliable model.\\n\\nAnother factor to ponder is when replacement might be a better option than repair. If your appliance has significant structural or functional issues, such as a faulty compressor in a refrigerator or a burned-out motor in a washing machine, it might be more practical to invest in a new appliance rather than spend money on extensive repairs.\\n\\nWarranty and service plans also play a role in making repair decisions. If your appliance is still under warranty or a service plan, it might be more cost-effective to get it repaired rather than replaced. However, if the warranty has expired or the service plan doesn't cover the necessary repairs, replacing the appliance might be the smarter choice.\\n\\nIn the end, the decision to repair or replace an appliance depends on several factors, including cost-effectiveness, age, condition, and warranty coverage. Consulting with a professional technician can offer valuable insights and suggestions based on your specific situation.\\n\\n## Assessing Energy Efficiency\\n\\nEnergy efficiency is a key factor to consider when thinking about replacing your appliances. Energy-efficient appliances not only save you money on utility bills, they also contribute to a sustainable future.\\n\\nTo assess the energy efficiency of your appliances, look for their energy efficiency ratings. In the US, the Energy Star label is the most common rating system. Appliances with the Energy Star label meet the strict energy efficiency guidelines set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Energy (DOE).\\n\\nUpgrading to more energy-efficient appliances comes with several benefits. Firstly, these appliances use less energy, which means lower energy bills. Over time, the savings can be substantial. Additionally, energy-efficient appliances help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thus reducing your carbon footprint. They often come with advanced features and technologies that can enhance your overall user experience.\\n\\nAt Sears, we offer a wide range of energy-efficient appliances that can help you save both energy and money.

Proper disposal of old appliances, reducing environmental impact through responsible appliance replacement, and exploring eco-friendly options for appliance upgrades are all vital factors to consider.\\n\\nProper disposal methods for old appliances are important to prevent them from ending up in landfills and contributing to pollution. Instead of simply tossing them, consider recycling. Many appliance manufacturers and retailers offer recycling programs where you can drop off your old appliances for proper disposal.
