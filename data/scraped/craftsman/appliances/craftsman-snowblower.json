Whether it's a small walkway or a large driveway, assessing the area, snowfall patterns, and frequency will guide you in selecting the most suitable machine.\\n\\n### Evaluating the Area Size and Type\\n\\nThe size and type of area you need to clear are important factors in determining the power and size of the snow blower.\\n\\n- **Small Driveways or Walkways**: A single-stage snow blower is often sufficient. It's lightweight and easy to maneuver, making it perfect for smaller spaces.\\n- **Large Driveways or Areas with Rocks and Gravel**: A dual-stage or three-stage snow blower is better suited. These models handle larger spaces and can manage uneven terrain, like gravel or rocks, without difficulty.\\n\\n### Considering Average Snowfall and Depth\\n\\nUnderstanding your region's typical snowfall is key to choosing a snow blower that matches your needs.\\n\\n- **Frequent Heavy Snowfall**: Opt for a snow blower with a higher clearing capacity and longer throwing distance. These models are built to handle deep and heavy snow efficiently.\\n- **Lighter Snowfall**: A snow blower with a lower capacity might be sufficient, providing an efficient way to clear smaller amounts of snow.\\n\\n### Frequency of Snowfall\\n\\nHow often it snows in your area will also influence your choice.\\n\\n- **Consistent Snowfall Throughout Winter**: Invest in a robust and reliable snow blower that can withstand regular use. Durability and power will be important for frequent snow clearing.\\n- **Occasional Snowstorms**: A more budget-friendly option might be the right choice if snow is infrequent. These models provide adequate performance without the need for heavy-duty features.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![3 types of snow blowers infographic](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/6qRMQag0uz28l19VJn70Sj/9e2d1c3a3f7e646866357762ba5d62ff/3_types_of_snow_blowers_infographic.jpg)\\n\\n## Different Types of Snow Blowers\\n\\nUnderstanding the various types of snow blowers available will help you make an informed decision. Snow blowers generally fall into three categories: single-stage, dual-stage, and three-stage. Each type is designed to handle specific conditions and has its own set of features and advantages.\\n\\n### Single-Stage Snow Blower\\n\\nIdeal for light to moderate snowfall, a single-stage snow blower is designed to clear snow in a single pass using an [auger](/glossary/what-is-a-snowblower-auger) that both gathers and discharges the snow.\\n\\n- **Snow Handling**: Handles up to 9 inches of snow.\\n- **Best For**: Small to medium-sized driveways and walkways.\\n- **Advantages**:\\n  - Lightweight and easy to maneuver.\\n  - Compact, making it convenient for residential storage.\\n- **Considerations**:\\n  - Struggles with heavy or wet snow.\\n  - Not suitable for large areas or gravel surfaces.\\n\\n### Dual-Stage Snow Blower\\n\\nSo, what's the difference between single and two-stage snow blowers? The addition of an impeller to throw the snow. Also known as a two-stage snow blower, this type is more powerful and built to tackle heavier snowfall and larger areas.\\n\\n- **Snow Handling**: Efficient in deep snow and icy conditions.\\n- **Best For**: Large driveways, sidewalks, and parking lots.\\n- **Features**:\\n  - Uses an auger to collect snow and an impeller to blow it out through a chute.\\n  - Handles rough terrain, including gravel and uneven surfaces.\\n- **Considerations**:\\n  - Larger and requires more storage space.\\n  - More expensive than single-stage models.\\n\\n### Three-Stage Snow Blower\\n\\nThe three-stage snow blower represents the pinnacle of snow clearing technology, designed for the most demanding conditions.\\n\\n- **Snow Handling**: Capable of managing heavy, wet snow and ice with ease.\\n- **Best For**: Commercial use or clearing large areas like expansive driveways and lots.\\n- **Features**:\\n  - Uses an auger to collect snow, an impeller to break it down further, and an accelerator to expel it through the chute.\\n  - Offers the highest clearing capacity and speed.\\n- **Considerations**:\\n  - The most expensive and largest option.\\n  - May be overkill for small residential properties.\\n\\nEach type of snow blower has its unique strengths and is suited to different snow clearing needs. Whether you need a lightweight, easy-to-handle machine for occasional snow or a powerful tool for heavy-duty clearing, understanding these differences will help you choose the right one.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Important Snowblower Features and Factors to Consider\\n\\nSelecting the best snow blower for your needs involves more than just choosing the type; it’s also about understanding the features that can enhance its performance and ease of use. These key features and factors can make a big difference in how effectively you manage winter snow.\\n\\n### Power Steering\\n\\nPower steering is a valuable feature, especially when dealing with heavy and wet snow.\\n\\n- **Enhanced Maneuverability**: Makes it easier to navigate around obstacles and make sharp turns.\\n- **Reduced Strain**: Lessens the physical effort required, which can be a big advantage during extended use.\\n- **Best For**: Those with larger areas to clear or who regularly deal with heavy snowfall.\\n\\n### Chute Rotation and Pitch Control\\n\\nThe ability to control where the snow goes makes efficient clearing easier.\\n\\n- **Directional Control**: Adjust the direction and angle of snow discharge to suit your needs.\\n- **Precision**: Helps avoid piling snow in unwanted areas, keeping driveways and walkways clear.\\n- **Consideration**: Look for models that offer easy-to-use controls for quick adjustments.\\n\\n### Additional Useful Features\\n\\nSeveral additional features can further improve the usability and convenience of your snow blower:\\n\\n- **Headlights**:\\n  - **Visibility**: A must for clearing snow during low-light conditions, such as early mornings or late evenings.\\n  - **Safety**: Improves visibility, helping you spot obstacles in your path.\\n\\n- **Airless Tires**:\\n  - **Durability**: No risk of flats, ensuring that your snow blower is always ready to go.\\n  - **Maintenance**: Requires less upkeep compared to traditional tires.\\n\\n- **Electric Starters**:\\n  - **Ease of Use**: Allows you to start the machine with a simple push of a button, eliminating the need for pull cords.\\n  - **Convenience**: Particularly useful in cold weather when traditional pull starts can be more challenging.\\n\\nUnderstanding these features and how they align with your snow clearing needs will help you choose a snow blower that not only meets but exceeds your expectations. Prioritizing the features that matter most to you ensures that you’re well-equipped to handle whatever winter throws your way.\\n\\n---\\n\\nChoosing the right snow blower starts with understanding your needs and matching them with the appropriate features and capabilities. Whether you opt for a single-stage, two-stage, or three-stage machine, making an informed choice will make your winter snow clearing tasks much easier. Keeping your snow blower in good condition through regular [maintenance](/maintain) and timely repairs will help it perform at its best.\\n\\nIf you run into issues with your snow blower, Sears Home Services is ready to help.

Plan ahead: Don’t wait until the ground is covered in white to find out if your snow blower or snow thrower is in working order. A pre-winter tune-up for your snow blower is more than preparation—it's essential prevention. These check-ups ward off mid-season failures, ensuring your snow blower can handle every snowfall. Our maintenance service will keep your machine in peak condition, avoiding common issues that could disrupt your snow clearing plans.\\n\\nTake advantage of our [complete snow blower maintenance service](/maintain/snow-blower-maintenance) that includes:\\n* Checking the ignition, starter systems, carburetor, throttle and choke controls.\\n* Cleaning the engine cooling fins.\\n* Changing the oil.\\n* Lubricating moving parts.\\n* Inspecting and adjusting drive belts and chains.\\n\\n## Easy Snow Blower DIY Repairs\\nIf you do encounter some problems, below are four things you can easily fix yourself. Tackling snow blower repairs yourself isn’t just rewarding—it’s cost-effective. Just remember to disconnect the spark plug and battery cables before repairing any power equipment. And don’t forget to wear safety glasses and gloves to protect against harmful chemicals and debris.\\n\\n### 1. Replace the Scraper Blade\\nConstant use wears down the scraper blade, whose job it is to scrape the surface of snow and ice underneath your snow blower. The scraper blade is located in front of the auger. This feeds the snow to the impeller, which then blows the snow out. To fix the scraper blade, unscrew all the bolts holding the blade. Remove the damaged blade from the auger housing and then install a new blade.\\n\\nTo avoid wearing down the scraper blade prematurely, set the skid shoes at the proper height as shown in this DIY video:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ElOMhx1Hyg\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n### 2. Replace a Broken Shear Pin\\nA shear pin is actually designed to break if the auger shaft is over-torqued — you don’t want the gear shaft to be damaged if you get something stuck in the auger. To fix this problem, lift the auger housing until the handle sits on the ground. The broken shear pin should fall out. If part of the pin is still in the shaft, use a small hammer to remove it. Install the new pin and tighten the bolt with a wrench.\\n\\n### 3. Replace a Drift Cutter\\nThe drift cutters are mounted on both sides of the auger. They help you clear more efficiently by cutting into high snow and directing it into the auger housing instead of letting it fall on top of the snow blower. If one or both are bent, you can replace them with new parts. To do so, loosen the wing nuts, remove the bolts and slide the drift cutters off. To replace, just insert bolts into the new parts and tighten the wing nuts.\\n\\n### 4. Replace Worn Skid Shoes\\nSkid shoes slide along the ground to protect the sides of the auger housing from damage and also allow you to adjust the clearance between the scraper blade and the ground. These parts wear out over time by scraping over concrete and pavement. Many skid shoes have 2 sides so you can just reverse the skid shoes if both sides aren't already worn out.\\n\\nYou can replace them by doing the following:\\n1. Lift the auger housing and use a block of wood to keep it off the ground.\\n2. Remove the bolts and pull off the worn skid shoes.\\n3. Install the new skid shoes and tighten the bolts.\\n\\nAdjust the skid shoes as shown in the above video.\\n\\n![Image of the snowblower needing repair](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/58MMn4JBEbiZ8iSJZjfWeM/cf1db63e05ee6122901ab29366ea69ea/Image_of_the_snowblower_needing_repair.jpg)\\n\\n## How to Get Your Snow Blower Repaired\\nWhile some snow blower repairs are fairly easy to do, there are times a trained service pro is needed.

By taking a few steps before storing your snow blower, you're preparing for a smooth start to the next snowy season.

Understanding snowblower safety is imperative for anyone learning how to use a snowblower. To unclog the snowblower chute and housing safely, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Turn off the snowblower.** If you have a gas-powered snowblower, shut off the engine and allow it to cool. Disconnect the spark plug wire to prevent accidental starting. For an electric snowblower, remove the safety key.\\n\\n2. **Wait for moving parts to stop.** Allow all moving parts to come to a complete stop. This includes the impeller and auger.\\n\\n3. **Use a snow removal tool.** Use a snow removal tool or a sturdy stick to carefully break up and remove the clogged snow. Avoid using your hands because sharp parts or debris can cause cuts.\\n\\n4. **Inspect the parts.** Check the chute, auger, and impeller for any foreign objects such as branches or rocks that could be causing clogs. Remove any obstructions.\\n\\n5. **Restart the snowblower.** After clearing the clog and making sure all tools are removed, reconnect the spark plug wire or insert the safety key and start the snowblower to confirm everything is working properly.\\n\\nTo prevent future clogs, keep an eye on snow conditions. Avoid trying to clear extremely heavy or wet snow, as this can increase the likelihood of clogs.\\n\\nTo further prevent clogs, coat the snowblower housing and chute with SNOW-JET, a non-stick polymer spray for snowblowers. SNOW-JET eliminates snow buildup in the chute and auger housing, so you don't have to stop to clear snow from the snowblower, saving time and fuel. SNOW-JET also reduces friction, allowing snow to blow efficiently through the housing and chute.\\n\\nRegular maintenance is key to snowblower safety and optimal performance. Yearly professional maintenance will also help prevent clogs. [Schedule Sears Home Services Snowblower Maintenance](/maintain/snow-blower-maintenance) to keep your machine in top shape. During professional maintenance, the Sears Home Services technician will:\\n\\n* Check the ignition, starter systems, carburetor, throttle, and choke controls.\\n* Clean the engine cooling fins.\\n* Change the oil.\\n* Lubricate moving parts.\\n* Inspect and adjust drive belts and chains.\\n\\nKeeping your snowblower running smoothly all season long starts with a tune-up in the fall or early winter.\\n\\n## Myth 2: You Can Unclog Your Snow Blower With Your Hands as Long as It’s Off\\n\\n__Busted!__ Snowblowers come with a clearing tool, but a sturdy stick or long ice scraper will also work. Don’t ever reach into a clogged snowblower chute, housing, or near the [snowblower auger](/glossary/what-is-a-snowblower-auger) or impeller with your hands, even when the snowblower is off. Sharp parts or foreign objects caught in the clogged snow can cause serious cuts.\\n\\n## Myth 3: All Snowblowers Are Created Equal\\n\\n__Busted!__ You can choose from single-stage, dual-stage and three-stage snowblowers designed for various snow-clearing needs. You can also choose gas-powered or battery-powered models. The size and type of the snowblower that’s right for you depends on your property size, typical snow accumulation and terrain.\\n\\n![Image of large snowblower clearing snow](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/3UkINqPLIT50Ut4s9gyfMN/6ef88bed48feca8a2f5ad5fa0fe52546/Image_of_large_snowblower_clearing_snow.jpg)\\n\\n## Myth 4: Smaller Snowblowers Are Easier To Handle\\n\\n__Busted!__ Big snowblowers have engine-driven wheels, so steering is so easy it can seem like they’re self-propelled. Smaller models often aren’t self-propelled, so you have to do the pushing yourself.\\n\\nChoose the size and type of snowblower that’s right for your needs.\\n\\n## Myth 5: Your Snow Blower Can Be Stored Outside\\n\\n**Busted!** Storing your snowblower outside can cause gas lines to freeze, making it difficult to start. Always store your snowblower inside a shed or garage to protect it from harsh elements and ensure smooth operation.\\n\\nA large part of learning how to use a snowblower effectively involves following snowblower safety rules, proper care, and [yearly professional maintenance](/maintain).

Change the Spark Plug\\n\\nDisconnect the plug from the lead, and remove it with a wrench. If there’s damage or deposits, replace it. If not, pop it back in – secure but not too tight.\\n\\n### 2. Inspect the Belts\\n\\nDid you find excessive wear and tear? Cracks? If so, replace them.\\n\\n**Tip:** Snap a photo of the belts before you take them off so you’ll know exactly where they go.\\n\\n### 3. Give the Paddles Their Due\\n\\nThe auger paddles are the hardest working parts on your snow blower, so check them often for wear and tear. If they don’t hit the ground anymore, replace them.\\n\\n**Tip:** Order replacement parts from [searspartsdirect.com](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/), or play it safe and call the pros at Sears Home Services.\\n\\n### 4. Check the Shave Plate\\n\\nThis scrapes the snow off your driveway. If it’s worn on a single-stage snow blower, reverse it. For a two-stage snow blower, replace it. \\n\\n### 5. Flip the Skid Shoes\\n\\nThese are the adjustable pieces on a two-stage snow blower that let you set the height of your auger. Most are reversible. If yours look worn, flip the over and use the other side, making a note to replace them next year.\\n\\n### 6. See if Any Shear Pins are Damaged\\n\\nShear pins connect the auger to the gear case. Did you know they’re meant to break? It’s a safety feature – they’ll break if the auger and gear case are overloaded.\\n\\n**Tip:** Keep several extras in the garage. You don’t want to have them break with no replacements on hand.\\n\\n### 7. Change the Oil\\n\\nLet the blower warm up to make the oil flow easier. Then turn it off, pull the drain plug and drain the oil into a container. Pop the plug back in and fill the machine up with oil.\\n\\n### 8. Use Fresh Gas with Stabilizer\\nFill ‘er up with fresh gas (you did remember to empty it last season, right?) and make sure to include fuel stabilizer. It’ll keep the gas fresh longer and help prevent clogs.\\n\\nRemember to be safe when working with tools, and always protect yourself. If in doubt, call the pros at [Sears Home Services](/).\\n\"])",
