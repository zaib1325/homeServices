View our infographic for the best summer lawn care, including tips on watering, mowing and what to plant now.**\\n\\nYou don’t want to be that neighbor, the one with the overgrown lawn and unkempt garden that make everyone scowl as they drive by. There’s an art to creating a beautiful landscape around your home, but you don’t need to be a professional to do it. All it takes is a little TLC and some know-how.\\n\\nThere are the basics that go into grass care in summer, including mowing and watering, weeding, mulching and keeping pests at bay. But there are some things you can do to really damage your yard. Watering too much, for example, could turn your lawn into the Black Lagoon. Not keeping a handle on weeds can quickly escalate to an infestation. And skipping mulch might be depriving your garden of a powerhouse player.\\n\\nSo grab your garden shears, don a pair of work gloves, and get out there and enjoy the summer sunshine while you work your yard. Here are some tips to make your lawn and garden the envy of your neighborhood.\\n\\n![Mold](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/3X6HeRtberZjSR1Vn7FrEr/5aad52f3b70da054fa2e96c05a71f36a/Mold.jpg)\\n\\n## Mowing Tips for Summer\\n\\nRegular mowing helps maintain a healthy lawn throughout the summer. Proper mowing techniques encourage strong grass growth, prevent disease, and reduce weeds. A consistent mowing schedule, especially during dry periods, helps your lawn stay green even in hot weather. Keeping your mower blades sharp and setting the right mowing height will keep your grass looking lush.\\n\\n### How Often to Mow Your Lawn\\n\\n- **Mow Weekly:** Mow your lawn about once a week during the summer. This frequency keeps your lawn at the right height and looking tidy.\\n- **Adjust for Rain:** If there has been little to no rainfall, it's okay to mow less often to avoid stressing the grass.\\n\\n### Ideal Grass Height for Summer\\n\\n- **Optimal Height:** Keep your grass at a height of ¾ to 1½ inches. This range is ideal for most lawns and helps prevent stress and damage.\\n- **One-Third Rule:** Avoid cutting more than one-third of the grass blade length at a time. Cutting too much can weaken the grass and make it more likely to develop problems.\\n\\n### Importance of Sharp Mower Blades\\n\\n- **Clean Cuts:** Keep your mower blades sharp for a clean cut. Dull blades tear the grass, which can cause brown tips and increase the risk of disease.\\n- **Regular Maintenance:** Sharpen your mower blades at the start of the mowing season and after every 10 to 12 mowings to keep them effective.\\n\\nFollowing these mowing tips will help your lawn stay healthy and vibrant all summer, so it looks its best through the hottest months.\\n\\n## Watering Your Lawn Effectively\\n\\nProper watering helps maintain a healthy lawn during the summer. Watering your lawn correctly encourages grass roots to grow deep, making them more resilient to heat and drought. It also keeps the grass looking green and vibrant. Knowing when and how much to water can make all the difference in keeping your lawn lush throughout the summer months.\\n\\n### Best Time to Water Your Lawn\\n\\n- **Early Morning:** Water your lawn early in the morning, ideally between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. This allows the water to soak into the soil before the sun gets too hot, reducing evaporation and helping the grass absorb moisture effectively.\\n- **Evening Option:** If watering in the morning isn’t possible, late afternoon or early evening is the next best time. Aim for around 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. This gives the lawn enough time to dry before nightfall, which helps reduce the risk of fungal diseases.\\n\\n### How Much Water Does Your Lawn Need?\\n\\n- **Deep Watering:** Aim to give your lawn about 1 to 1.5 inches of water per week, including rainfall. This amount lets water reach the roots, promoting deeper growth and making the grass more drought-resistant.\\n- **Watering Frequency:** Instead of watering lightly every day, water deeply every few days. This practice encourages the grass to develop deep roots, which are more resilient during dry spells.\\n\\n### Tips for Efficient Watering\\n\\n- **Avoid Overwatering:** Overwatering can lead to shallow roots and increase the risk of lawn diseases. Check the soil moisture before watering by sticking a screwdriver or a similar tool into the soil. If it goes in easily, the lawn likely has enough moisture.\\n- **Use Sprinklers Wisely:** If using a sprinkler, set a timer to prevent overwatering. Choose a sprinkler that distributes water evenly across the lawn to make sure all areas get adequate hydration.\\n\\nBy following these watering tips, your lawn can stay healthy and green, even during the hottest parts of summer. Proper watering not only improves grass health but also conserves water, making your lawn care routine more efficient and sustainable.\\n\\n## Mulching and Weed Control\\n\\nMulching and effective weed control are key practices for maintaining soil health and keeping your garden free of unwanted growth. Mulch provides numerous benefits, including moisture retention, soil temperature regulation, and weed suppression. Pairing mulch with proper weed management helps create a healthy environment for your plants to thrive.\\n\\n### Benefits of Mulching\\n\\n- **Weed Suppression:** A layer of mulch helps block sunlight from reaching weed seeds, reducing their chances of germination. This makes it easier to keep your garden beds clean and free of weeds.\\n- **Moisture Retention:** Mulch helps the soil retain moisture by slowing evaporation. This is especially important during the hot summer months when water can evaporate quickly from exposed soil.\\n- **Soil Health:** Organic mulch, such as wood chips or shredded leaves, gradually decomposes and adds nutrients back into the soil, improving its overall health and fertility.\\n- **Erosion Prevention:** Mulch helps prevent soil erosion by breaking the impact of rain and irrigation, which protects plant roots and keeps soil in place.\\n\\n### Mulching Tips\\n\\n- **Apply Correctly:** Use 2 to 3 inches of mulch around your plants. A thicker layer may prevent water and air from reaching the roots, while a thinner layer may not be as effective at suppressing weeds.\\n- **Avoid Plastic:** Do not use plastic sheeting under mulch. It can prevent nutrients from reaching the soil and restrict water flow.\\n- **Choose Quality Mulch:** Purchase mulch from a reliable source to avoid introducing weed seeds or contaminants into your garden.\\n\\n### Practical Weed Control Tips\\n\\n- **Timing Matters:** Weeding after a rain or watering makes it easier to pull weeds out by the roots. If the soil is dry, use a hoe or hand weeder to cut weeds just below the surface.\\n- **Stay Consistent:** Regular weeding prevents weeds from going to seed and spreading throughout your garden. Aim to weed at least once a week during the growing season.\\n- **Target Young Weeds:** Remove weeds when they are young and have not yet established deep root systems. This makes them easier to pull and reduces their ability to compete with your plants for nutrients and water.\\n\\nBy combining mulching with effective weed control, you can maintain a healthy garden that supports plant growth and minimizes the need for constant maintenance. These practices help create a thriving garden environment that looks great and supports healthy plant development.\\n\\n## Planting and Pest Control\\n\\nSelecting the right plants and managing pests naturally are vital for maintaining a healthy and productive garden. By choosing fast-growing summer plants suited to your climate and using natural pest deterrents, you can create a thriving garden that requires less maintenance and promotes biodiversity. \\n\\n### Choosing Fast-Growing Summer Plants\\n\\n- **Vegetables:** For a productive vegetable garden, consider planting fast-growing summer vegetables like beans, cucumbers, corn, and beets. These plants thrive in warm weather and can provide a bountiful harvest throughout the season.\\n- **Herbs:** Herbs such as basil, oregano, thyme, and sage grow quickly in the summer and add fresh flavors to your cooking. They also attract beneficial insects that help keep pests at bay.\\n- **Flowers:** Add vibrant color to your garden with summer-blooming flowers like marigolds, asters, black-eyed Susans, blanket flowers, and zinnias. These flowers are not only beautiful but also attract pollinators, which can improve the health and yield of your garden.\\n\\n### Tips for Successful Planting\\n\\n- **Know Your Climate:** Choose plants that are well-suited to your local climate. Native plants are often the best choice because they are adapted to the region's weather conditions and soil, making them easier to grow and maintain.\\n- **Stagger Planting Times:** To enjoy a continuous harvest, plant different crops at staggered intervals. This approach ensures that you always have something fresh to pick throughout the summer.\\n\\n### Natural Pest Control Methods\\n\\n- **Attract Beneficial Insects:** Planting specific herbs and flowers can attract insects that prey on common garden pests. Coriander, dill, spearmint, garlic, marigolds, and yarrow are great choices for attracting ladybugs and lacewings, which feed on aphids, mites, mealybugs, and other harmful insects.\\n- **Companion Planting:** Use companion planting techniques to naturally deter pests. For example, planting marigolds alongside tomatoes can help repel nematodes, while basil planted near peppers can deter aphids.\\n- **Maintain Garden Health:** Healthy plants are less likely to suffer from pest infestations. Regularly check your plants for signs of damage or stress, and address any issues promptly to keep your garden thriving.\\n\\nBy selecting the right plants and using natural pest control methods, you can create a beautiful and productive garden that requires less intervention and supports a healthy ecosystem. These strategies not only help protect your plants but also promote a sustainable gardening environment.\\n\\n## Tool Maintenance and Garden Prep\\n\\nTaking care of your gardening tools and preparing your garden for the next season are important steps for keeping your outdoor space in great shape. [Regular maintenance extends the life of your equipment](/maintain/lawn-and-garden) and helps make gardening more effective. Preparing for fall involves transitioning your garden and planning for the cooler months ahead.\\n\\n### Maintaining Your Gardening Tools\\n\\n- **Clean After Use:** Scrub your gardening tools with warm, soapy water to remove dirt and debris. Rinse them thoroughly and let them air dry to prevent rust.\\n- **Smooth Wood Handles:** Sand any rough patches on wooden handles to prevent splinters and improve grip. This simple step makes your tools safer and more comfortable to use.\\n- **Oil Your Tools:** Apply a light coating of oil to metal parts to protect them from rust and keep them working smoothly. Use a non-petroleum-based oil on wood handles to maintain their condition and prevent cracking.\\n\\n### Deadheading and Garden Maintenance\\n\\n- **Remove Spent Blooms:** Regularly deadhead your plants by removing dead or fading blooms. This practice encourages new growth and keeps your garden looking vibrant throughout the season.\\n- **Tidy Up:** Keep your garden beds clean by removing fallen leaves, weeds, and other debris. This not only improves the appearance of your garden but also helps reduce pests and diseases.\\n\\n### Preparing Your Garden for Fall\\n\\n- **Plant Cool-Weather Crops:** As summer winds down, consider planting cool-weather crops like broccoli, carrots, lettuce, and spinach. These vegetables thrive in cooler temperatures and can provide a harvest well into the autumn months.\\n- **Plan for Perennials:** Take note of which perennials performed well this summer and consider dividing or moving them to optimize garden space for next year.\\n- **Transitioning Your Lawn:** Late summer is also a good time to prepare your lawn for fall. Consider aerating your lawn and applying a slow-release fertilizer to strengthen grass roots before winter.\\n\\n### Riding Mower Maintenance and Repair\\n\\nFor those with riding mowers, keeping your equipment in good condition is key to maintaining a beautiful lawn. Regular tasks, such as sharpening blades and checking oil levels, help produce clean cuts and healthy grass.\\n\\n- **Schedule Maintenance:** To keep your riding mower running smoothly, **schedule regular maintenance with Sears Home Services**.
