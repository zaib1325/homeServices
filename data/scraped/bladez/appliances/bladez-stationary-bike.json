You'll also learn about the average cost to expect for materials and installation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Vinyl Siding Cost by Type\\n\\n### Vinyl Shake Siding\\n\\nThe cost of vinyl shake siding can vary significantly based on several factors, such as the brand, quality, style, location, and the size of the project.\\nOn average, the cost of vinyl shake siding can range from $6 to $15 per square foot, including materials and installation. This cost may also vary depending on the complexity of the installation process, any additional features, and the contractor's labor charges.\\n\\n### Insulated Vinyl Siding\\n\\nYou may choose siding with additional insulation, particularly if your house tends to be poorly insulated. \\nThe average cost of installing insulated vinyl siding can range from $5 to $16 per square foot. This price includes the cost of the insulated siding, labor, and other installation expenses. Keep in mind that these are just estimates, and the actual cost might be different in your specific area and depending on your particular project details.\\n\\n### Board and Batten\\n\\nBoard and batten vinyl siding provides a bold look for cottage style homes. On average, the cost of board and batten vinyl siding can range from $5 to $10 per square foot for materials and installation. The average cost can vary depending on where you live and the details of your siding project.\\n\\n### Clapboard Siding\\n\\nVinyl clapboard siding mimics the look of overlapping horizontal wood planks. This is one of the most popular types of vinyl siding. Clapboard vinyl siding typically costs between $5 and $12 per square foot to install. The actual cost to install clapboard siding on your home will depend on the type of siding that you choose, complexity of the installation process, any additional features, and the contractor's labor charges.\\n\\n### Vertical Vinyl Siding\\n\\nThe cost of vertical vinyl siding can range from $3 to $9 per square foot for materials only. You’ll need to add the cost of siding installation by a local contractor to figure the total cost of your project.\\n\\n### Vinyl Log Siding\\nVinyl log siding is a type of exterior cladding for buildings that replicates the appearance of traditional log cabins or log homes. It’s designed to mimic the natural and rustic look of wood logs. The cost of this siding typically ranges from $5 to $10 per square foot. This estimate includes the cost of materials and labor. However, keep in mind that prices can vary significantly based on your location and the specific contractor you choose.\\n\\n### Vinyl Stone Siding\\n\\nVinyl stone siding comes in panels or tiles that are manufactured to resemble various types of natural stones, such as limestone, slate, or river rock. The panels are molded or embossed with textures and patterns that replicate the look and feel of genuine stone.\\n\\nThe cost of installing vinyl stone siding varies according to the type of stone that you choose and the area that you live in. This type of siding typically costs between $7 and $15 per square foot to install including materials and labor.\\n\\n### Vinyl Brick Siding\\n\\nVinyl brick siding is made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and is commonly used to cover and protect the exterior walls of homes. The cost of installing vinyl brick siding typically costs from $7 to $15 per square foot. The specific cost of covering your home with vinyl brick siding may vary based on your location and the cost of labor charged by local contractors.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Factors to Consider When Calculating Vinyl Siding Cost\\n\\nHow much your vinyl siding will cost depends on many factors in addition to the particular quality of siding you choose. The total area of your home’s exterior will determine the amount of siding needed. If your home is irregularly shaped, this makes for a more challenging installation and can result in more scrap and man-hours.\\n\\nIf you are not doing the installation yourself, there are labor costs to consider. If you need to remove your old siding before installation, this will add to the total, as well.\\n\\nThe [cost of siding](https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/siding/install-siding/) typically runs between $3 and $12 per square foot. You can approximate the exterior of your home as rectangles and triangles to estimate the total area. The area of any rectangular space is the base x height. The area of any triangular spaces is ½ base x height. The total area is the sum.\\n\\nYou can then multiply the total estimated area by the unit price to get the total cost of the siding. For example, if your home has an exterior area of 1,200 square feet, the total cost would be between $2 x 1,200 = $2,400 and $7 x 1,200 = $8,400.\\n\\nBut other materials you need to consider are nails, trim pieces, and so on. Soffits or fascia pieces may be anywhere from $1 and $20 per linear foot, depending on the material chosen. It’s also often a good idea to include 10% additional material, as this is often how much waste is produced by cutting pieces to the appropriate size.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How to Reduce Vinyl Siding Costs\\n\\nHere are some tips to help you lower the overall cost of your home siding replacement project.\\n\\n* Start by researching different vinyl siding options and suppliers. Compare prices from multiple vendors to find the best deals and discounts.\\n* If you have the necessary skills and experience, consider installing the vinyl siding yourself.

Follow the detailed steps in this helpful YouTube video to resolve travel problems with your garage door:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/giZuLTMIOzc\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n## Reason 2: Safety Sensor Problems -- Resolving Photo Sensor Issues\\n\\nA common reason for the Liftmaster blinking light on your garage door opener could be photo sensor issues. Photo sensors, which detect obstacles to prevent accidents, are a crucial safety feature. When these sensors malfunction, they can trigger garage door opener codes and disrupt the operation of your garage door. The light blinks 10 times on many garage door openers to signify a problem with the safety sensors. View this helpful DIY YouTube video to resolve safety sensor alignment and failure issues with your garage door opener:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D1-jABFaOLU\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e  \\n\\nTo troubleshoot, start by cleaning and realigning the photo sensors. Next, check for any obstructions or blockages that might interfere with their operation. If the problem persists, consider resetting the photo sensor alignment as per your garage door opener's manual. If you're uncertain about performing these tasks, don't hesitate to contact a professional garage door technician for help.\\n\\n## Reason 3: Wiring Failures -- Addressing Wiring Problems\\n\\nWiring issues could be another reason why your Liftmaster blinking light is flashing an error code. Addressing these problems can resolve the error and restore your garage door opener's functionality.\\n\\nCommon wiring issues include loose or disconnected wires, frayed or damaged wires, and short circuits. Inspecting the wiring connections, repairing or replacing damaged wires, and ensuring proper electrical connections can help eliminate garage opener light blinking and ensure the smooth operation of your garage door opener. Unplug the garage door opener motor unit and examine all wiring connections using the owner’s manual as a reference. However, if you're uncomfortable with this electrical work, [schedule garage door opener repair service](/repair/garage-door-opener-repair-service) and we’ll send a Sears Home Services technician to fix the problem.\\n\\n## Reason 4:  Garage Door Opener Power Issues\\n\\nA lack of power going to your garage door opener can sometimes be resolved by simply resetting the house circuit breaker for the garage door opener outlet.

The logic control board also sends current to operate the motor that moves the door. When the logic board fails, the garage door opener may not sense remote or wall control signals or it may not send current to operate the drive motor to move the door. A service technician is often needed to diagnose and repair a logic control board failure. If you suspect a control board failure in your garage door opener, you’ll likely need to schedule service.\\n\\nSears Home Services is your best source for garage door opener troubleshooting and repair help.

So, without further ado, let's dive into the world of reading and using wiring diagrams for DIY appliance repair.\\n\\nReading a wiring diagram can feel overwhelming—like a foreign language. But you can learn and understand the basics of using a wiring diagram by studying the following 3 sections of wiring diagram training. Videos in each section will help you become an expert at using a wiring diagram in no time.\\n\\n__Warning:__ **When completing DIY appliance diagnosis and repair, ALWAYS unplug the appliance before accessing internal components and making checks or repairs.**\\n\\n## 1. Decipher the Symbols Used in Wiring Diagrams\\n\\nFirst, we’ll take a look at some of the most common symbols you’ll find in a wiring diagram and learn what they mean. \\n\\n* __Lines__. The lines are wires. They connect the symbols, which represent components of the appliance. Following the lines will help you determine, the cause of a failure and buy the right part to fix the problem. \\n\\n* __Switches__. Most appliances have switches. The symbol for a switch on a wiring diagram looks like this: \\\\___/    ___ . The switch starts and stops current going to a circuit or component in the appliance.\\n\\n* __Dots__. Dots on a wiring diagram signify wiring connections to switches and components.\\n\\nLearn more about the basic symbols you’ll find on a wiring diagram (also called a wiring schematic) by viewing this short video.\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gaz-8cGVMxE\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nMany wiring diagrams have the symbols labeled, or they have a symbol key on the diagram to help you decipher the symbols.\\n\\nHere are a few more examples of common symbols you’ll see on appliance wiring diagrams.\\n\\n![Appliance wiring diagram symbols](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/2SwH0Mh0qLjYJpLtcPhbGx/54d782a318e0329cb73791962e37837d/Appliance_wiring_diagram_symbols.jpeg)\\n\\n## 2.

Should you choose to undertake repairs or maintenance, you are assuming the risk of injury to your person or property. In an effort to reduce the risk, use the proper tools and safety equipment noted in the applicable guide and follow all instructions. Always** __UNPLUG__ **the appliance or disconnect electrical power by shutting off the house circuit breaker before beginning diagnosis and/or repair. Do not proceed until you are confident that you understand all of the steps and are capable of completing the repair. Some repairs or maintenance, however, should only be performed by a qualified technician.**\\n\\n[Schedule in-home service by a Sears Technician](/repair) when you encounter an appliance failure that you can’t fix yourself. \\nSears Technicians perform more than 3 million repairs annually and we have 1,500+ appliance experts employed nationwide.
