Other components that can stop a microwave from heating are the diode or magnetron. Only a licensed technician should replace a door switch, diode or magnetron.\nSchedule microwave repair service to have these failures fixed.How do I fix my microwave when the turntable isn't turning?When the turntable in your microwave isn’t rotating, first check that it's properly aligned on the turning mechanism. It can easily become loose and fail to turn properly. When this happens, you'll quickly notice your food isn’t heating or cooking as it should.\nThe turntable is turned by a motor-driven coupler and roller guide. If the motor is causing the problem, a qualified technician can carry out a live voltage test and check the opening of the coupler for cracks or damage.What to do if the microwave is sparking or arcing?If you notice sparks inside your microwave while it's running, it could be because foil or utensils are inside, or the interior paint could be chipped, exposing the metal of the microwave.\nIf there are spatters of food inside your microwave, they could be continuing to cook when you turn it on, which can also cause sparks.\nClean the internal cavity of your microwave thoroughly. Sparking can also be due to a shorted or opened high voltage diode, or because the stirrer isn’t working. The stirrer helps distribute the energy inside the microwave evenly. If the drive motor or stirrer belt is broken, the stirrer won’t work and energy will be concentrated in one area of your microwave, leading to sparking.\nMicrowaves can store a lethal amount of electricity and it's extremely important that a licensed technician test it and replace electric components if necessary. If you're having a problem with your built-in microwave, call us for assistance.How do I fix a broken microwave touchpad?If the touchpad on your microwave isn’t working properly, you won’t be able to make the selections you need to heat or cook your food. The touchpad can be damaged by water or insect infestation, but the good news is that both the touchpad and control panel can be repaired or replaced.Ready to get your Hisense microwave working again?

Other components that can stop a microwave from heating are the diode or magnetron. Only a licensed technician should replace a door switch, diode or magnetron.\nSchedule microwave repair service to have these failures fixed.How do I fix my microwave when the turntable isn't turning?When the turntable in your microwave isn’t rotating, first check that it's properly aligned on the turning mechanism. It can easily become loose and fail to turn properly. When this happens, you'll quickly notice your food isn’t heating or cooking as it should.\nThe turntable is turned by a motor-driven coupler and roller guide. If the motor is causing the problem, a qualified technician can carry out a live voltage test and check the opening of the coupler for cracks or damage.What to do if the microwave is sparking or arcing?If you notice sparks inside your microwave while it's running, it could be because foil or utensils are inside, or the interior paint could be chipped, exposing the metal of the microwave.\nIf there are spatters of food inside your microwave, they could be continuing to cook when you turn it on, which can also cause sparks.\nClean the internal cavity of your microwave thoroughly. Sparking can also be due to a shorted or opened high voltage diode, or because the stirrer isn’t working. The stirrer helps distribute the energy inside the microwave evenly. If the drive motor or stirrer belt is broken, the stirrer won’t work and energy will be concentrated in one area of your microwave, leading to sparking.\nMicrowaves can store a lethal amount of electricity and it's extremely important that a licensed technician test it and replace electric components if necessary. If you're having a problem with your built-in microwave, call us for assistance.How do I fix a broken microwave touchpad?If the touchpad on your microwave isn’t working properly, you won’t be able to make the selections you need to heat or cook your food.

        "content": "self.__next_f.push([1,\"## What is a Magnetron?\\n\\nA magnetron is a type of vacuum tube that generates microwaves using the interaction between a stream of electrons and a magnetic field. \\n\\nOriginally developed in the 1920s for radar technology, magnetrons made their way into home microwave ovens in the 1940s. The magnetron is the device responsible for producing the high-frequency radio waves that we know as microwaves. \\n\\nIn microwave ovens, these waves penetrate food, causing the water molecules inside to vibrate rapidly, which generates heat through friction of molecules colliding together and cooks the food.\\n\\n## How Does a Magnetron Generate Microwaves?\\n\\nThe magnetron might look like a small, unassuming part of your microwave oven, but it contains complex components that create powerful electromagnetic waves. Here’s a breakdown of how it works.\\n\\n* __Electron Emission:__ Inside the magnetron, there’s a filament or cathode, which, when heated, releases electrons. This filament is typically made of tungsten or another metal that can withstand high temperatures.\\n* __Magnetic and Electric Fields:__ Surrounding the cathode are magnets and an anode, which create magnetic and electric fields. The magnetic field, generated by powerful permanent magnets, is perpendicular to the electric field inside the tube.\\n* __Electron Oscillation:__ The electrons emitted by the cathode are drawn toward the positively charged anode. However, due to the magnetic field, they do not travel in a straight line. Instead, the electrons are forced into a spiral or circular path around the anode.\\n* __Cavities and Resonance:__ The anode is shaped with several hollow cavities. As the electrons spiral around, they pass these cavities, which are precisely tuned to resonate at microwave frequencies, usually around 2.45 GHz (the frequency used in most microwave ovens).\\n* __Microwave Generation:__ As the electrons pass by the cavities, they induce an oscillating electric field within them, generating microwave radiation at the cavity’s resonant frequency. The microwaves are then guided out of the magnetron and into the cooking chamber of the microwave oven.\\n\\n![how-a-microwave-oven-works-image](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/1cBaXaOd9nf97CkGzPoO0j/2aa9d620963231754d3fb9a1dcb6f1cf/how-a-microwave-works-image.png)\\n\\n## Directing the Microwaves to the Food\\n\\nHere’s the process that a microwave oven uses to heat food:\\n\\n* Once the microwaves are produced, they travel through a small metal tube known as a waveguide. \\n* The waveguide channels the microwaves from the magnetron into the cooking chamber. \\n* From there, the microwaves bounce around, reflecting off the metal walls of the chamber until they encounter food. \\n* When they reach the food, the waves penetrate the surface and cause the water molecules to vibrate, heating the food quickly and efficiently.\\n\\n## Why Do Microwaves Heat Food So Quickly?\\n\\nThe efficiency of microwave heating lies in molecular friction. Water molecules in food are polar, meaning they have positive and negative ends.\\n\\n When exposed to microwaves, these molecules attempt to align with the rapidly changing electric fields, causing them to spin and vibrate millions of times per second. This motion creates heat due to friction, which then spreads throughout the food.\\n\\nSince the microwaves penetrate the outer layers and heat the food from the inside and out, they cook or reheat food much faster than conventional ovens, which rely on transferring heat through conduction from the outer surface inward.\\n\\n## Safety Features of Magnetrons\\n\\nBecause magnetrons generate high-energy radiation, microwave ovens are equipped with several safety features:\\n\\n* __Shielded Chamber:__ Microwave ovens have metal-lined doors and walls that prevent microwaves from escaping.\\n* __Door Interlocks:__ The oven’s door has switches that disable the magnetron if the door is opened, ensuring that microwaves don’t accidentally leak out.\\n\\nThese features make modern microwaves safe for everyday use, allowing the magnetron to work its magic only when it’s fully enclosed.\\n\\n## Maintaining Your Microwave for Safe Operation\\n\\nFollow the instructions in the owner’s manual for your microwave oven to keep it well-maintained and operating safely. \\n\\nKeep the inside of the oven cavity clean and free of splatters. Splatters can cause arc marks inside the cavity. When you see small arc marks inside the cavity, follow the tips in this video to repair the damage:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y-2q2hi_gvk\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nAs noted in the video, when you see large arc marks or damage in the microwave oven cavity, schedule [microwave repair](/repair/microwave-repair-service) to have a service technician visit your home and fix the damage.\\n\\nIn addition to keeping the oven cavity of your microwave clean, schedule yearly professional [microwave maintenance](/maintain) to have a Sears Home Services technician visit your home and check all microwave functions, make any necessary adjustments and perform professional cleaning to keep your appliance in top shape and lasting longer.\\n\\n## Innovations in Magnetron Technology\\n\\nThough magnetrons have been largely unchanged in domestic microwaves, recent innovations aim to improve their efficiency, precision, and energy consumption. \\n\\nSome advanced microwave ovens now use inverter technology, which can adjust the power level for more precise cooking instead of simply turning the magnetron on and off. This improvement allows for more even heating, which reduces the chances of overcooking or creating cold spots in food.\\n\\nAdditionally, solid-state microwave technology, which uses semiconductors to produce microwaves, is emerging as a potential replacement for magnetrons. Solid-state microwaves can be controlled more precisely, allowing for more even heating and better energy efficiency.\\n\\n## Fun Fact: The Accidental Discovery of the Microwave Oven\\n\\nMicrowave ovens were invented by accident. In 1945, Percy Spencer, an engineer working for Raytheon, was testing radar equipment when he noticed that a chocolate bar in his pocket had melted. Curious, he tested other foods and quickly realized that microwaves generated by the magnetron could heat food. \\n\\nBy 1947, the first commercial microwave ovens were introduced—though they were massive and cost thousands of dollars. Today’s sleek, affordable microwaves owe their existence to this happy accident.\\n\\nIn summary, the magnetron is an essential part of microwave ovens, creating the microwaves that cook food quickly and efficiently. \\n\\nIt achieves this through a complex interaction of electron flow, magnetic fields, and carefully tuned cavities, transforming electrical energy into high-frequency waves that heat food from within. \\n\\nSo next time you use your microwave oven, take a moment to appreciate the magnetron and its fascinating science. This little device is what makes your quick meals possible, blending engineering and physics in a truly remarkable way.\\n\"])",

        "content": "self.__next_f.push([1,\"Microwaves are convenient kitchen appliances, but like any other electronic devices, they can experience various failures. There are many reasons why your microwave won’t work right. \\n\\nHere are common causes and safe resolutions for microwave malfunctions.\\n\\n## Microwave Won’t Turn On\\n\\nWhen the microwave has no power at all, start by making sure that its power cord is plugged in. Next, make sure the electrical outlet is working. Plug a small lamp or appliance into the electrical outlet. If the outlet has no power, reset the house circuit breaker for the outlet. If the outlet is still dead, you’ll need to have an electrician fix the electrical outlet.\\n\\nIf the electrical outlet is okay and power cord is plugged in securely, a failed electronic control board or internal wire failure could be preventing the microwave from powering up. A service technician will need to diagnose and repair these types of failures. You may also consider replacing the microwave when it won’t work at all.\\n\\nIf you have a Samsung microwave needing repair, we can help. Our local technicians offer [Samsung repair near you](/repair/samsung), to get your microwave working again quickly. We also offer repair for most other major brand microwaves.\\n\\n## Microwave Won’t Start\\n\\nWhen the microwave won’t start, one of these failures could be causing the problem.\\n\\n* __Broken door switch.__ The microwave won’t start unless the control detects that the door is fully shut. A bad door switch won’t accurately detect that the door is closed. A technician will need to replace a bad door switch or you’ll need to replace the microwave when it won’t start due to a bad door switch.\\n* __Blown internal fuse.__ Internal fuses blow when an electrical short occurs or when the microwave overheats. A service technician will need to diagnose and repair the microwave when an internal fuse blows. Replacing the microwave is another option you can consider.\\n* __Faulty magnetron.__ The magnetron produces the high-energy waves that heat the food in the microwave. Check the owner’s manual for your microwave when you suspect a magnetron failure. The magnetron in some microwaves has a 10 year part warranty but you have to pay for labor to replace the magnetron. You may consider having the microwave repaired when the magnetron fails and the part is under warranty. If the magnetron isn’t under warranty, you’ll likely need to replace the microwave.\\n* __Bad diode or high-voltage capacitor.__ The microwave components need to be replaced by a technician when they fail. You may also consider replacing the microwave instead of repairing it.\\n* __Defective electronic control board.__ A bad control board can prevent the microwave from heating. A technician would need to test the control board output and repair the microwave if it has a defective control board. Replacing the microwave is another option when the appliance has this failure.\\n\\n## Microwave Won’t Heat\\n\\nThe same failures listed above except for a broken door switch will prevent the microwave from heating while it runs. A technician will need to diagnose and repair the problem or you can replace the microwave when it won’t heat.\\n\\n## Arc Marks Inside the Microwave\\n\\nIf you notice sparks inside your microwave while it's running, it could be because foil or utensils are inside, or the interior paint could be chipped, exposing the metal of the microwave. If there are spatters of food inside your microwave, they could be continuing to cook when you turn it on, which can also cause sparks. Clean the internal cavity of your microwave thoroughly.\\n\\nYou can repair some types of arc marks and burns using [touch-up paint](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/product/2n6r3jijvj-0026-110/id-72017). \\n\\nThis video will walk you through that process and show you some ways that you can avoid burning your microwave in the future.\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y-2q2hi_gvk\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nFor microwaves that are not stainless steel on the inside, you can repair arc marks up to the size of a quarter using this touch-up paint, but only if the marks appear on the inside walls, the floor, or the ceiling. Don't attempt repairs on the outer frame, or the door. Any repairs to the door or frame could affect the shielding and cause radiation leaks. And don’t attempt repairs on burn marks larger than a quarter, as that could be a sign of a more serious problem and should be checked out by a service technician. Also, don't use this repair on microwaves with a stainless steel the inside, because the paint won’t stick.\\n\\nIf you’re unable to repair arc marks or burns inside the cavity, schedule service by a technician or replace the microwave.\\n\\n## Microwave Light Won’t Work\\n\\nA burnt out light bulb often prevents the internal light or cooktop light from working in your microwave. Check the owner’s manual for your model to see if you can replace the light bulb yourself. Follow the instructions in the manual to replace the light if you find that procedure covered. \\n\\nIn many microwaves, the internal light needs to be replaced or fixed by a service technician. Schedule service or continue to use the microwave without the internal light. You can also replace the microwave when the internal light quits working and you’re unable to safely fix the problem yourself.\\n\\nIf replacing the light bulb doesn’t fix the problem, a wiring failure, bad light socket or defective control could be preventing the light from working. Schedule [microwave oven repair](/repair/microwave-repair-service) or replace it unless you can do without the light.\\n\\n## Turntable Not Moving\\n\\nWhen the turntable in your microwave isn’t rotating, first check that it's properly aligned on the turning mechanism. It can easily become loose and fail to turn properly. Aligning the turntable properly may fix the problem.\\n\\nNext, check the settings to make sure turntable rotation is selected. Adjust the turntable setting if necessary.\\n\\nIf the above troubleshooting tips don’t help, then a bad turntable motor or a wiring failure could be preventing the tray from rotating. You’ll need to have a service technician diagnose the problem and fix the microwave when the turntable won’t move. You can also replace the microwave.\\n\\n## Touchpad Not Working\\n\\nWhen the touchpad isn’t working, try unplugging the microwave power cord for 3 minutes to reset the electronic control board. Plug the microwave back in to restore electrical power. The touchpad may work normally. If not, you’ll need to have the microwave repaired because the control board or touchpad will likely need replacing. You can also replace the microwave instead of repairing it.\\n\\n## Microwave Repair Safety\\n\\n__Don’t attempt microwave repairs that aren’t covered in the owner’s manual.__ Microwaves have a high-voltage capacitor that retains a lethal electrical charge even when the microwave power cord is unplugged. Also, a service technician needs to test the microwave for radiation leakage following any disassembly or repair. Don’t risk your health and safety by attempting DIY microwave repairs.\\n\\n[Schedule microwave service through Sears Home Services](/repair/microwave-repair-service) when your microwave needs repair.\\n\\nBecause microwaves are inexpensive appliances, it’s often less expensive to replace the unit rather than repairing it. *We can help you with that, too.*\\n\\n### Replacing Your Microwave\\n\\nTo seamlessly replace your microwave (and other appliances if needed), visit our [Sears.com Upgrade page](https://www.sears.com/upgrade) to conveniently select a new appliance or appliances and get help with special financing.\\n\\nWe’ve consolidated all help, [financing offers](https://www.sears.com/en_us/dap/sears-credit-offers-members.html) and savings into one location on our Upgrade page to make it easy for you to replace your appliances now.

This field agitates water molecules in the food, causing them to vibrate quickly and generate heat. This heat is then transferred to other parts of the food, ensuring even cooking. Microwaves cook quickly and efficiently because microwave energy heats only the food, not the whole oven cavity.\\n\\nFour vital components create the electromagnetic microwave field inside the cooking chamber:\\n\\n* __Magnetron:__ This electron tube is the microwave’s power source, generating the high-energy electrons that cook your food. The magnetron produces microwaves by channeling electrical energy into a heated filament. This creates a flow of electrons that transmits microwaves into the microwave cavity. The microwaves bounce around through the metal interior cavity of the oven and are absorbed by the food. The microwaves agitate water molecules in the food, causing them to vibrate quickly and generate heat. This heat is then transferred to other parts of the food, ensuring efficient and even cooking.\\n* __High-voltage transformer:__ This component supplies the high-energy electrical power needed by the magnetron to produce the stream of electrons. \\n* __High-voltage capacitor:__ The microwave's capacitor works with a diode to convert the alternating current power output of the transformer to direct current (DC), increasing the voltage to nearly 5,000 volts. This additional voltage is necessary to power the microwave's magnetron.\\n* __Wave guide:__ The wave guide directs the microwaves from the magnetron into the microwave oven cavity.\\n\\nAlthough heat is produced directly in the food by agitating water molecules, microwave ovens don’t cook food from the inside out as many think. When thick foods are cooked, the outer layers are heated and cooked primarily by microwaves while the inside of thick food items is cooked mainly by the conduction of heat from the hot outer layers.\\n\\nGlass, paper, ceramic, or plastic containers must be used in microwave cooking because microwaves pass through these materials. Although such containers cannot be heated by microwaves, they can become hot from the heat of the food cooking inside them. Generally, metal pans or aluminum foil should not be used in a microwave oven, as the microwaves are reflected off these materials causing the food to cook unevenly and possibly damaging the oven cavity.\\n\\nIf you accidently use foil or metal containers inside the microwave, schedule [microwave repair](/repair/microwave-repair-service) service to have a technician examine the appliance and make sure that it’s safe to continue using.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![how-the-convection-oven-works-image](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/2TWcEAhDbSc6GBFelqgD3t/eedf1510321fc4ce819df33842cef77d/how-does-a-convection-oven-work-image.png)\\n\\n## How the Convection Oven Works\\n\\nA convection oven uses a fan and heating element to circulate hot air throughout the oven cavity to heat food. Circulating the air around the food promotes even cooking. Although not as fast as microwave cooking, convection cooking does heat items faster than a conventional oven without the fan. An air fryer is a type of convection oven that uses a more powerful fan than the convection oven.\\n\\nThe fan removes moisture from the oven cavity during baking, which helps foods get crisp – something a microwave won’t do. This results in baked goods with crispy crusts and tender insides. It also creates crispy skins on meats.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How the Convection Microwave Oven Combines the Methods\\n\\nHaving the best of both worlds is always better. Although convection microwave has multiple cooking modes so you can use either method on its own, cooking with both methods at once will cook food faster and crispier. While the microwave function quickly heats the food by agitating water molecules using high-energy electrons, the convection element and fan work together to heat the outer layers of the food and create a crispy crust that helps the food retain moisture and stay tender and juicy inside.\\n\\nHere are distinct advantages of using a convection microwave oven:\\n\\n* __Faster cook times:__ Items cook faster because the convection element, fan and microwave system heat the food simultaneously in different ways.\\n* __Even cooking:__ The fan circulates hot air to cook food evenly while the microwaves also do the same. \\n* __Moist food:__ Convection cooking helps food retain moisture by creating an outer crust. \\n* __Better flavor:__ Convection cooking improves the flavor of food by browning the outer layers and creating crispy skins on meat.\\n* __Uses less energy:__ Because they cook faster and more efficiently, convection microwaves use less energy than a traditional oven.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Maintaining a Convection Microwave Oven\\n\\nFollow the instructions in the owner’s manual for your convection microwave oven for maintenance and cleaning. Keep the inside of the oven cavity clean and free of splatters. Splatters can cause arc marks inside the cavity. When you see small arc marks inside the cavity, follow the tips in this video to repair the damage:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y-2q2hi_gvk\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nAs noted in the video, when you see large arc marks or damage in the microwave oven cavity, schedule [microwave repair](/repair/microwave-repair-service) to have a service technician visit your home and fix the damage.\\n\\nIn addition to keeping the oven cavity of your microwave clean, schedule yearly professional [microwave maintenance](/maintain) to have a Sears Home Services technician visit your home and check all microwave functions, make any necessary adjustments and perform professional cleaning to keep your appliance in top shape and lasting longer.\\n\\n---\\n\"])",

Built-in microwaves often last more than 15 years. If your microwave is near or past its retirement age, replacing it might be a better option due to the increased likelihood of recurring issues and lack of replacement parts. \\n\\n### Type of Microwave\\n\\nFor countertop and microhood models, you’ll almost always be better off replacing the appliance rather than repairing it once its warranty has ended. Microwave repairs can easily match or exceed the replacement cost of these models. \\n\\nFor a built-in microwave, you’ll typically want to repair the appliance and keep it for as long as possible because it matches the oven and other kitchen appliances. It can be difficult to buy a matching replacement for a built-in microwave.\\n\\n### Cost of Repairs\\n\\nIf the cost of repairing a microwave comes close to or exceeds the price of a new one, it might make more financial sense to replace it. However, if the costs of repairing are relatively low and the microwave isn’t too old, it could be worth repairing the microwave.\\n\\n### Frequency of Problems\\n\\nFrequent malfunctions could indicate that your microwave is nearing the end of its lifespan. In such cases, investing in a new microwave could save you from continuous repair costs.\\n\\n## Benefits of Repairing a Microwave\\n\\nRepairing your microwave has several advantages:\\n\\n* __Cost-effectiveness:__ Repairing a microwave can be more affordable than buying a new one, which can save you money. By repairing your microwave, you can extend its lifespan and avoid the expense of a new appliance – especially for built-in models.\\n* __Convenience:__ It’s often much more convenient to repair the microwave and keep it instead of shopping, ordering and having a new microwave installed (or installing it yourself if possible). Because you use your microwave practically every day, you’ll likely want the problem fixed quickly through repair.\\n* __Eco-friendly:__ Opting for repairing a microwave reduces electronic and solid waste, contributing to a more sustainable environment. It helps preserve natural resources, decrease pollution from manufacturing, and reduce the carbon footprint associated with producing new appliances.\\n* __Maintaining kitchen appliance consistency:__ When your microwave is built-in and you’re unable to find a replacement compatible with your oven and other kitchen appliances, repairing it lets you keep that upscale and functional look in your kitchen.\\n\\nAt Sears Home Services, we have experienced microwave repair experts who can diagnose your microwave and fix it quickly. We have access to repair parts for all major microwave brands. Get in touch today to schedule [microwave oven repair](/repair/microwave-repair-service).\\n\\n## When Replacing Your Microwave Makes Sense\\n\\nWhile there are benefits to repairing a microwave, there are also situations where it might be more practical to replace it.\\n\\n* __Safety concerns:__ If your microwave shows signs of safety hazards, such as a malfunctioning door or sparks, it’s safer to replace it rather than attempting a repair.\\n* __Outdated technology:__ Microwaves have evolved over time with new features and improved efficiency. If your microwave lacks these modern functionalities such as air frying, replacing it with an upgraded model could enhance your cooking experience.\\n* __Desire for a new look:__ If you want a microwave with a more modern look or a sleek model that updates your kitchen, replacing your microwave when it needs repair is the right call for you.\\n* __Repair is impractical:__ As noted above, it’s often impractical to repair a countertop or over-the-range microwave because the repair will cost more than buying a new model.\\n\\n![Sears.com Upgrade page image](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/PADBJ0wsbIfXJuqLz3MHZ/b2aebf069596ed45286c859c580e0ff7/Sears_dot_com_Upgrade_page_image.png)\\n\\nWhen you need to replace your microwave, visit our [Sears.com Upgrade page](https://www.sears.com/upgrade) to find special offers and financing to help make your appliance replacement easy and seamless. You’ll find appliance package deals that will enable you to transform your entire kitchen all at once.\\n\\nWhen pondering whether it is worth repairing a microwave and possibly your other kitchen appliances, remember that the final decision depends on your specific situation and needs.\\n\\n## Scheduling a Microwave Repair\\n\\nConsulting with a microwave technician can offer valuable insights into whether a repair is feasible. A technician can diagnose the issue, identify necessary parts, and estimate the cost of repairing a microwave oven.\\n\\nObtaining multiple repair quotes allows you to compare prices and determine the best option for your budget. Remember, the cheapest quote isn’t always the best choice; quality and reliability of repairs are important factors too.\\n\\nAlso, consider any manufacturer warranty that may still be valid. Many microwaves come with warranties that cover certain repairs or replacements for a specific period. Checking your warranty can help you determine if the costs of repairing a microwave would be covered partially or fully by the manufacturer.\\n\\nBy seeking expert advice, getting multiple quotes, and considering your warranty, you can make an informed decision and get the best value for your money.\\n\\nTo get the best advice and help with a microwave repair, [schedule service through our Sears Home Services website](/repair/microwave-repair-service).

kitchen, powering the microwaves that cook or reheat our food in seconds. But have you ever wondered how these fascinating devices work? \\\\n\\\\nUnderstanding the science behind magnetrons opens up a world of physics and engineering that’s not only interesting but reveals just how ingenious microwave ovens really are. Let’s take a closer look at what magnetrons are, how they work, and why they’re so efficient for heating food.\\\\n\\\",\\\"keyTakeaway1\\\":\\\"A magnetron generates microwaves by directing electrons through magnetic and electric fields, forcing them to oscillate and create microwave radiation. This microwave energy is then directed to the cooking chamber, where it heats food efficiently.\\\",\\\"keyTakeaway2\\\":\\\"Microwaves cause water molecules in food to vibrate at high frequencies, creating heat through molecular friction. This method allows microwaves to cook or reheat food quickly from the inside out, unlike conventional ovens, which heat from the outside in.\\\",\\\"keyTakeaway3\\\":\\\"Modern microwave ovens include safety features like shielded chambers and door interlocks to prevent microwave leakage. Recent advances, such as inverter technology and solid-state microwaves, enhance energy efficiency and cooking precision.\\\",\\\"information\\\":\\\"$1d\\\",\\\"secondaryClassification\\\":\\\"APPLIANCE 101\\\",\\\"faqQuestion1\\\":\\\"What is a magnetron’s role in a microwave?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer1\\\":\\\"It generates the microwave radiation that heats food.
