We know the importance of keeping your HVAC system maintained and ready to use on a daily basis.\nSears Home Services has been working on Carrier systems for years. Our experienced HVAC techs know these systems inside and out.\nHere a rundown of the common problems that our technicians face when repairing Carrier systems.\nAC Not Cooling Right\nImagine yourself in the middle of summer and your house feels like an oven even with the AC running. We get these calls all day long when the temperature climbs.\nThe first thing to check is your air filter. Sounds too simple, but you wouldn't believe how many service calls come down to a clogged filter. When air can't flow through, the coil gets too cold and freezes up. Now you've got no cooling at all. Change those filters every month during the summer to keep your system running smoothly.\nRefrigerant levels get low over time. Tiny leaks that are hard to spot let that coolant escape bit by bit. Your Carrier might run all day but never get the house comfortable. Low refrigerant also makes the compressor work too hard. It wears it out way faster than normal. Adding refrigerant isn't a DIY job these days. Techs need special licenses and equipment to handle it legally.\nSchedule central air repair service whenever you notice diminished cooling and basic troubleshooting doesn’t fix the problem.\nOutdoor Unit Problems\nCondenser coils get filthy, especially if you've got cottonwood trees in your yard or lots of dust in your area. The outdoor unit can't dump heat properly when those coils get gunked up. The system runs and runs but doesn't cool well. You can spray them gently with a hose, but be careful not to bend the fins. They're real delicate.\nCondenser fan motors burn out from working too hard in the heat. You'll know it's happening when you hear humming but the fan's not turning. Or it starts up then shuts off after a few minutes. The motor's probably overheating. Replacing one takes electrical know-how and the right parts.\nSchedule professional HVAC repair when you notice problems with your outside unit.\nFurnace Won't Light\nCold night and the heat won't kick on. Just great. Carrier furnaces are usually reliable, but they've got their common issues same as any brand.\nGas supply problems happen more than you'd think. Make sure the gas valve's open. Sounds obvious but easy to miss. If someone shut it off and forgot to turn it back on, that's your problem right there.\nIf the igniter cracks or breaks, the gas won't light. Newer Carriers use hot surface igniters instead of pilot lights. They glow orange when working right. If yours isn't lighting up when the furnace tries to start, it's probably shot.\nSchedule gas furnace repair service as soon as you notice an ignition problem that you can’t fix on your own.\nBlower Issues\nBlower motors quit or act up at times on Carrier systems. Maybe it runs but makes noise, or it won't run at the right speed. Bad capacitors cause this a lot. That's the part that gives the motor its initial kick to start spinning. They weaken over time and eventually fail completely.\nLimit switches shut the furnace down if it gets too hot. Safety feature to prevent fires. Problem is, they go bad or get triggered for other reasons. Dirty filters make the furnace run hot, trip that switch. Fix the real problem and the switch stops causing trouble.\nCount on Sears Home Services to get to the bottom of blower issues quickly. Schedule service and we’ll have your Carrier system working properly again in no time.\nStrange Noises\nCarriers aren't usually noisy units when they're running right. New sounds mean something's wrong almost every time.\n\nRattling usually means something's loose. Cover panels, duct connections, mounting bolts. Track down what's vibrating and tighten it up. Easy fix most times.\nScreeching or squealing points to bearings going bad in a motor or fan. Bearings aren't made to last forever, especially in the heat of a furnace or in the weather outside. They need replacement before they seize up completely.\nBooming sound when the furnace lights could be delayed ignition. Gas builds up before lighting, then whoosh! This is a dangerous situation. It could be a clogged burner or bad gas valve. Don't ignore this one – it can lead to bigger problems. Schedule furnace repair right away.\nGrinding noises almost always mean something's wearing metal on metal. Shut the system down before parts get damaged beyond repair. Usually it's a motor bearing completely shot, or something's come loose and is hitting the fan. Schedule service and a technician will fix the issue.\n\nThermostat Problems\nSometimes the issue isn't the Carrier unit at all. It's the thermostat telling it what to do.\n\nBatteries die and people forget that some thermostats even have them. The system just stops responding one day. Put in fresh ones every year whether they seem dead or not.\nWiring comes loose, especially in older homes where things settle and shift. Tiny wires connect to little terminal screws inside the thermostat. They work loose and suddenly your AC runs all the time or won't come on at all.\nProgramming gets messed up. People hit buttons without realizing what they've changed. The schedule gets altered or the system gets put in a mode you didn't want. Check your manual for the button instructions to program your system properly and adjust the settings.\n\nFrequent Cycling\nSystem running for just a couple minutes, shutting off, then starting again soon after? That's short cycling. Bad for equipment, bad for comfort, bad for your energy bills.\nOversized units cycle more than properly sized ones. If your Carrier's too big for the space, it cools too quickly, shuts down, then has to start up again soon. Not much to do about this except replace the system with the right size unit when it's time.\nDirty flame sensors make furnaces shut down right after lighting. They can't tell the flame is there, so they shut off the gas as a safety measure. Cleaning that sensor sometimes fixes it. You just need a bit of fine sandpaper and to know where to find the sensor.\nLow refrigerant in AC systems trips the pressure switch. The unit shuts down to protect itself and tries to run again after a while. Round and round it goes. Finding and fixing the leak is the real solution, not just adding more refrigerant.\nCarrier Heat Pumps\nCarrier heat pumps have their own special issues. They cool in summer like an AC but also heat in winter by running the cooling cycle backward. Clever, but more complex.\nReversing valves stick or fail. That's the part that switches between heating and cooling. When it gets stuck, you might have cooling but no heat, or the opposite. Sometimes tapping on the valve body frees it up temporarily, but it'll need replacement eventually.\nDefrost problems show up in winter. The outdoor coil needs to defrost periodically when it's cold out. Ice builds up, and the unit has to melt it off to work right. Defrost control boards fail and leave you with a giant ice block where your heat pump used to be. Not good.\nSchedule heat pump repair service when you encounter heating or cooling problems with your Carrier system.\nDuctwork Matters Too\nThe best Carrier unit in the world won't work right if the ducts are bad. We find this all the time.\nLeaky ducts waste huge amounts of energy. Your expensive conditioned air just dumps into the attic or crawlspace. Sealing those leaks makes the whole system more effective.\nUndersized ducts restrict airflow. Carrier units need the right amount of air moving through them. Too little flow and the AC coil freezes or the furnace overheats. Ductwork that's too small chokes the whole system.\nWhen To Call For Help\nSome Carrier HVAC issues you can handle yourself. Change filters, clean around the outdoor unit, check breakers, change thermostat batteries. Basic maintenance stuff keeps things running right.\nBut when it comes to electrical problems, refrigerant issues, or gas-related furnace problems, that's when calling us makes sense. Our techs work on Carrier systems every day. What takes you hours of frustration (and probably a few trips to the hardware store), we knock out quickly.\nWe keep common Carrier parts on our trucks. Our techs get factory training on all their systems. Plus we stand behind our work with solid guarantees. Your comfort's too important to mess around with trial and error fixes from online videos.\nGive us a call when your Carrier system needs more than the basics. We'll get your home comfortable again without the headache of complex repairs. Too hot, too cold, too noisy - whatever the problem, we've seen it and fixed it countless times before.Are you in need of a Carrier HVAC system to be repaired or maintained?\nMake your appointment with Sears Home Services for a time that works best for you!

It's the thermostat telling it what to do.\n\nBatteries die and people forget that some thermostats even have them. The system just stops responding one day. Put in fresh ones every year whether they seem dead or not.\nWiring comes loose, especially in older homes where things settle and shift. Tiny wires connect to little terminal screws inside the thermostat. They work loose and suddenly your AC runs all the time or won't come on at all.\nProgramming gets messed up. People hit buttons without realizing what they've changed. The schedule gets altered or the system gets put in a mode you didn't want. Check your manual for the button instructions to program your system properly and adjust the settings.\n\nFrequent Cycling\nSystem running for just a couple minutes, shutting off, then starting again soon after? That's short cycling. Bad for equipment, bad for comfort, bad for your energy bills.\nOversized units cycle more than properly sized ones. If your Carrier's too big for the space, it cools too quickly, shuts down, then has to start up again soon. Not much to do about this except replace the system with the right size unit when it's time.\nDirty flame sensors make furnaces shut down right after lighting. They can't tell the flame is there, so they shut off the gas as a safety measure. Cleaning that sensor sometimes fixes it. You just need a bit of fine sandpaper and to know where to find the sensor.\nLow refrigerant in AC systems trips the pressure switch. The unit shuts down to protect itself and tries to run again after a while. Round and round it goes. Finding and fixing the leak is the real solution, not just adding more refrigerant.\nCarrier Heat Pumps\nCarrier heat pumps have their own special issues. They cool in summer like an AC but also heat in winter by running the cooling cycle backward. Clever, but more complex.\nReversing valves stick or fail. That's the part that switches between heating and cooling. When it gets stuck, you might have cooling but no heat, or the opposite. Sometimes tapping on the valve body frees it up temporarily, but it'll need replacement eventually.\nDefrost problems show up in winter. The outdoor coil needs to defrost periodically when it's cold out. Ice builds up, and the unit has to melt it off to work right. Defrost control boards fail and leave you with a giant ice block where your heat pump used to be. Not good.\nSchedule heat pump repair service when you encounter heating or cooling problems with your Carrier system.\nDuctwork Matters Too\nThe best Carrier unit in the world won't work right if the ducts are bad. We find this all the time.\nLeaky ducts waste huge amounts of energy. Your expensive conditioned air just dumps into the attic or crawlspace. Sealing those leaks makes the whole system more effective.\nUndersized ducts restrict airflow. Carrier units need the right amount of air moving through them. Too little flow and the AC coil freezes or the furnace overheats. Ductwork that's too small chokes the whole system.\nWhen To Call For Help\nSome Carrier HVAC issues you can handle yourself. Change filters, clean around the outdoor unit, check breakers, change thermostat batteries. Basic maintenance stuff keeps things running right.\nBut when it comes to electrical problems, refrigerant issues, or gas-related furnace problems, that's when calling us makes sense. Our techs work on Carrier systems every day. What takes you hours of frustration (and probably a few trips to the hardware store), we knock out quickly.\nWe keep common Carrier parts on our trucks. Our techs get factory training on all their systems. Plus we stand behind our work with solid guarantees. Your comfort's too important to mess around with trial and error fixes from online videos.\nGive us a call when your Carrier system needs more than the basics. We'll get your home comfortable again without the headache of complex repairs. Too hot, too cold, too noisy - whatever the problem, we've seen it and fixed it countless times before.Are you in need of a Carrier HVAC system to be repaired or maintained?\nMake your appointment with Sears Home Services for a time that works best for you!

We know the importance of keeping your HVAC system maintained and ready to use on a daily basis.\nSears Home Services has been working on Carrier systems for years. Our experienced HVAC techs know these systems inside and out.\nHere a rundown of the common problems that our technicians face when repairing Carrier systems.\nAC Not Cooling Right\nImagine yourself in the middle of summer and your house feels like an oven even with the AC running. We get these calls all day long when the temperature climbs.\nThe first thing to check is your air filter. Sounds too simple, but you wouldn't believe how many service calls come down to a clogged filter. When air can't flow through, the coil gets too cold and freezes up. Now you've got no cooling at all. Change those filters every month during the summer to keep your system running smoothly.\nRefrigerant levels get low over time. Tiny leaks that are hard to spot let that coolant escape bit by bit. Your Carrier might run all day but never get the house comfortable. Low refrigerant also makes the compressor work too hard. It wears it out way faster than normal. Adding refrigerant isn't a DIY job these days. Techs need special licenses and equipment to handle it legally.\nSchedule central air repair service whenever you notice diminished cooling and basic troubleshooting doesn’t fix the problem.\nOutdoor Unit Problems\nCondenser coils get filthy, especially if you've got cottonwood trees in your yard or lots of dust in your area. The outdoor unit can't dump heat properly when those coils get gunked up. The system runs and runs but doesn't cool well. You can spray them gently with a hose, but be careful not to bend the fins. They're real delicate.\nCondenser fan motors burn out from working too hard in the heat. You'll know it's happening when you hear humming but the fan's not turning. Or it starts up then shuts off after a few minutes. The motor's probably overheating. Replacing one takes electrical know-how and the right parts.\nSchedule professional HVAC repair when you notice problems with your outside unit.\nFurnace Won't Light\nCold night and the heat won't kick on. Just great. Carrier furnaces are usually reliable, but they've got their common issues same as any brand.\nGas supply problems happen more than you'd think. Make sure the gas valve's open. Sounds obvious but easy to miss. If someone shut it off and forgot to turn it back on, that's your problem right there.\nIf the igniter cracks or breaks, the gas won't light. Newer Carriers use hot surface igniters instead of pilot lights. They glow orange when working right. If yours isn't lighting up when the furnace tries to start, it's probably shot.\nSchedule gas furnace repair service as soon as you notice an ignition problem that you can’t fix on your own.\nBlower Issues\nBlower motors quit or act up at times on Carrier systems. Maybe it runs but makes noise, or it won't run at the right speed. Bad capacitors cause this a lot. That's the part that gives the motor its initial kick to start spinning. They weaken over time and eventually fail completely.\nLimit switches shut the furnace down if it gets too hot. Safety feature to prevent fires. Problem is, they go bad or get triggered for other reasons. Dirty filters make the furnace run hot, trip that switch. Fix the real problem and the switch stops causing trouble.\nCount on Sears Home Services to get to the bottom of blower issues quickly. Schedule service and we’ll have your Carrier system working properly again in no time.\nStrange Noises\nCarriers aren't usually noisy units when they're running right. New sounds mean something's wrong almost every time.\n\nRattling usually means something's loose. Cover panels, duct connections, mounting bolts. Track down what's vibrating and tighten it up. Easy fix most times.\nScreeching or squealing points to bearings going bad in a motor or fan. Bearings aren't made to last forever, especially in the heat of a furnace or in the weather outside. They need replacement before they seize up completely.\nBooming sound when the furnace lights could be delayed ignition. Gas builds up before lighting, then whoosh! This is a dangerous situation. It could be a clogged burner or bad gas valve. Don't ignore this one – it can lead to bigger problems. Schedule furnace repair right away.\nGrinding noises almost always mean something's wearing metal on metal. Shut the system down before parts get damaged beyond repair. Usually it's a motor bearing completely shot, or something's come loose and is hitting the fan. Schedule service and a technician will fix the issue.\n\nThermostat Problems\nSometimes the issue isn't the Carrier unit at all. It's the thermostat telling it what to do.\n\nBatteries die and people forget that some thermostats even have them. The system just stops responding one day. Put in fresh ones every year whether they seem dead or not.\nWiring comes loose, especially in older homes where things settle and shift. Tiny wires connect to little terminal screws inside the thermostat. They work loose and suddenly your AC runs all the time or won't come on at all.\nProgramming gets messed up. People hit buttons without realizing what they've changed. The schedule gets altered or the system gets put in a mode you didn't want. Check your manual for the button instructions to program your system properly and adjust the settings.\n\nFrequent Cycling\nSystem running for just a couple minutes, shutting off, then starting again soon after? That's short cycling. Bad for equipment, bad for comfort, bad for your energy bills.\nOversized units cycle more than properly sized ones. If your Carrier's too big for the space, it cools too quickly, shuts down, then has to start up again soon. Not much to do about this except replace the system with the right size unit when it's time.\nDirty flame sensors make furnaces shut down right after lighting. They can't tell the flame is there, so they shut off the gas as a safety measure. Cleaning that sensor sometimes fixes it. You just need a bit of fine sandpaper and to know where to find the sensor.\nLow refrigerant in AC systems trips the pressure switch. The unit shuts down to protect itself and tries to run again after a while. Round and round it goes. Finding and fixing the leak is the real solution, not just adding more refrigerant.\nCarrier Heat Pumps\nCarrier heat pumps have their own special issues. They cool in summer like an AC but also heat in winter by running the cooling cycle backward. Clever, but more complex.\nReversing valves stick or fail. That's the part that switches between heating and cooling. When it gets stuck, you might have cooling but no heat, or the opposite. Sometimes tapping on the valve body frees it up temporarily, but it'll need replacement eventually.\nDefrost problems show up in winter. The outdoor coil needs to defrost periodically when it's cold out. Ice builds up, and the unit has to melt it off to work right. Defrost control boards fail and leave you with a giant ice block where your heat pump used to be. Not good.\nSchedule heat pump repair service when you encounter heating or cooling problems with your Carrier system.\nDuctwork Matters Too\nThe best Carrier unit in the world won't work right if the ducts are bad.

We know the importance of keeping your HVAC system maintained and ready to use on a daily basis.\nSears Home Services has been working on Carrier systems for years. Our experienced HVAC techs know these systems inside and out.\nHere a rundown of the common problems that our technicians face when repairing Carrier systems.\nAC Not Cooling Right\nImagine yourself in the middle of summer and your house feels like an oven even with the AC running. We get these calls all day long when the temperature climbs.\nThe first thing to check is your air filter. Sounds too simple, but you wouldn't believe how many service calls come down to a clogged filter. When air can't flow through, the coil gets too cold and freezes up. Now you've got no cooling at all. Change those filters every month during the summer to keep your system running smoothly.\nRefrigerant levels get low over time. Tiny leaks that are hard to spot let that coolant escape bit by bit. Your Carrier might run all day but never get the house comfortable. Low refrigerant also makes the compressor work too hard. It wears it out way faster than normal. Adding refrigerant isn't a DIY job these days. Techs need special licenses and equipment to handle it legally.\nSchedule central air repair service whenever you notice diminished cooling and basic troubleshooting doesn’t fix the problem.\nOutdoor Unit Problems\nCondenser coils get filthy, especially if you've got cottonwood trees in your yard or lots of dust in your area. The outdoor unit can't dump heat properly when those coils get gunked up. The system runs and runs but doesn't cool well. You can spray them gently with a hose, but be careful not to bend the fins. They're real delicate.\nCondenser fan motors burn out from working too hard in the heat. You'll know it's happening when you hear humming but the fan's not turning. Or it starts up then shuts off after a few minutes. The motor's probably overheating. Replacing one takes electrical know-how and the right parts.\nSchedule professional HVAC repair when you notice problems with your outside unit.\nFurnace Won't Light\nCold night and the heat won't kick on. Just great. Carrier furnaces are usually reliable, but they've got their common issues same as any brand.\nGas supply problems happen more than you'd think. Make sure the gas valve's open. Sounds obvious but easy to miss. If someone shut it off and forgot to turn it back on, that's your problem right there.\nIf the igniter cracks or breaks, the gas won't light. Newer Carriers use hot surface igniters instead of pilot lights. They glow orange when working right. If yours isn't lighting up when the furnace tries to start, it's probably shot.\nSchedule gas furnace repair service as soon as you notice an ignition problem that you can’t fix on your own.\nBlower Issues\nBlower motors quit or act up at times on Carrier systems. Maybe it runs but makes noise, or it won't run at the right speed. Bad capacitors cause this a lot. That's the part that gives the motor its initial kick to start spinning. They weaken over time and eventually fail completely.\nLimit switches shut the furnace down if it gets too hot. Safety feature to prevent fires. Problem is, they go bad or get triggered for other reasons. Dirty filters make the furnace run hot, trip that switch. Fix the real problem and the switch stops causing trouble.\nCount on Sears Home Services to get to the bottom of blower issues quickly. Schedule service and we’ll have your Carrier system working properly again in no time.\nStrange Noises\nCarriers aren't usually noisy units when they're running right. New sounds mean something's wrong almost every time.\n\nRattling usually means something's loose. Cover panels, duct connections, mounting bolts. Track down what's vibrating and tighten it up. Easy fix most times.\nScreeching or squealing points to bearings going bad in a motor or fan. Bearings aren't made to last forever, especially in the heat of a furnace or in the weather outside. They need replacement before they seize up completely.\nBooming sound when the furnace lights could be delayed ignition. Gas builds up before lighting, then whoosh! This is a dangerous situation. It could be a clogged burner or bad gas valve. Don't ignore this one – it can lead to bigger problems. Schedule furnace repair right away.\nGrinding noises almost always mean something's wearing metal on metal. Shut the system down before parts get damaged beyond repair. Usually it's a motor bearing completely shot, or something's come loose and is hitting the fan. Schedule service and a technician will fix the issue.\n\nThermostat Problems\nSometimes the issue isn't the Carrier unit at all. It's the thermostat telling it what to do.\n\nBatteries die and people forget that some thermostats even have them. The system just stops responding one day. Put in fresh ones every year whether they seem dead or not.\nWiring comes loose, especially in older homes where things settle and shift. Tiny wires connect to little terminal screws inside the thermostat. They work loose and suddenly your AC runs all the time or won't come on at all.\nProgramming gets messed up. People hit buttons without realizing what they've changed. The schedule gets altered or the system gets put in a mode you didn't want. Check your manual for the button instructions to program your system properly and adjust the settings.\n\nFrequent Cycling\nSystem running for just a couple minutes, shutting off, then starting again soon after? That's short cycling. Bad for equipment, bad for comfort, bad for your energy bills.\nOversized units cycle more than properly sized ones. If your Carrier's too big for the space, it cools too quickly, shuts down, then has to start up again soon. Not much to do about this except replace the system with the right size unit when it's time.\nDirty flame sensors make furnaces shut down right after lighting. They can't tell the flame is there, so they shut off the gas as a safety measure. Cleaning that sensor sometimes fixes it. You just need a bit of fine sandpaper and to know where to find the sensor.\nLow refrigerant in AC systems trips the pressure switch. The unit shuts down to protect itself and tries to run again after a while. Round and round it goes. Finding and fixing the leak is the real solution, not just adding more refrigerant.\nCarrier Heat Pumps\nCarrier heat pumps have their own special issues. They cool in summer like an AC but also heat in winter by running the cooling cycle backward. Clever, but more complex.\nReversing valves stick or fail. That's the part that switches between heating and cooling. When it gets stuck, you might have cooling but no heat, or the opposite. Sometimes tapping on the valve body frees it up temporarily, but it'll need replacement eventually.\nDefrost problems show up in winter. The outdoor coil needs to defrost periodically when it's cold out. Ice builds up, and the unit has to melt it off to work right. Defrost control boards fail and leave you with a giant ice block where your heat pump used to be. Not good.\nSchedule heat pump repair service when you encounter heating or cooling problems with your Carrier system.\nDuctwork Matters Too\nThe best Carrier unit in the world won't work right if the ducts are bad. We find this all the time.\nLeaky ducts waste huge amounts of energy. Your expensive conditioned air just dumps into the attic or crawlspace. Sealing those leaks makes the whole system more effective.\nUndersized ducts restrict airflow. Carrier units need the right amount of air moving through them. Too little flow and the AC coil freezes or the furnace overheats. Ductwork that's too small chokes the whole system.\nWhen To Call For Help\nSome Carrier HVAC issues you can handle yourself.

        "content": "Carrier HVAC Repair and TroubleshootingWhether it’s your central air conditioner, ductless mini-split, furnace or boiler, Sears Home Services will send a qualified HVAC repair service technician to your home to repair and maintain your Carrier system. We know the importance of keeping your HVAC system maintained and ready to use on a daily basis.\nSears Home Services has been working on Carrier systems for years. Our experienced HVAC techs know these systems inside and out.\nHere a rundown of the common problems that our technicians face when repairing Carrier systems.\nAC Not Cooling Right\nImagine yourself in the middle of summer and your house feels like an oven even with the AC running. We get these calls all day long when the temperature climbs.\nThe first thing to check is your air filter. Sounds too simple, but you wouldn't believe how many service calls come down to a clogged filter. When air can't flow through, the coil gets too cold and freezes up. Now you've got no cooling at all. Change those filters every month during the summer to keep your system running smoothly.\nRefrigerant levels get low over time. Tiny leaks that are hard to spot let that coolant escape bit by bit. Your Carrier might run all day but never get the house comfortable. Low refrigerant also makes the compressor work too hard. It wears it out way faster than normal. Adding refrigerant isn't a DIY job these days. Techs need special licenses and equipment to handle it legally.\nSchedule central air repair service whenever you notice diminished cooling and basic troubleshooting doesn’t fix the problem.\nOutdoor Unit Problems\nCondenser coils get filthy, especially if you've got cottonwood trees in your yard or lots of dust in your area. The outdoor unit can't dump heat properly when those coils get gunked up. The system runs and runs but doesn't cool well. You can spray them gently with a hose, but be careful not to bend the fins. They're real delicate.\nCondenser fan motors burn out from working too hard in the heat. You'll know it's happening when you hear humming but the fan's not turning. Or it starts up then shuts off after a few minutes. The motor's probably overheating. Replacing one takes electrical know-how and the right parts.\nSchedule professional HVAC repair when you notice problems with your outside unit.\nFurnace Won't Light\nCold night and the heat won't kick on. Just great. Carrier furnaces are usually reliable, but they've got their common issues same as any brand.\nGas supply problems happen more than you'd think. Make sure the gas valve's open. Sounds obvious but easy to miss. If someone shut it off and forgot to turn it back on, that's your problem right there.\nIf the igniter cracks or breaks, the gas won't light. Newer Carriers use hot surface igniters instead of pilot lights. They glow orange when working right. If yours isn't lighting up when the furnace tries to start, it's probably shot.\nSchedule gas furnace repair service as soon as you notice an ignition problem that you can’t fix on your own.\nBlower Issues\nBlower motors quit or act up at times on Carrier systems. Maybe it runs but makes noise, or it won't run at the right speed. Bad capacitors cause this a lot. That's the part that gives the motor its initial kick to start spinning. They weaken over time and eventually fail completely.\nLimit switches shut the furnace down if it gets too hot. Safety feature to prevent fires. Problem is, they go bad or get triggered for other reasons. Dirty filters make the furnace run hot, trip that switch. Fix the real problem and the switch stops causing trouble.\nCount on Sears Home Services to get to the bottom of blower issues quickly. Schedule service and we’ll have your Carrier system working properly again in no time.\nStrange Noises\nCarriers aren't usually noisy units when they're running right. New sounds mean something's wrong almost every time.\n\nRattling usually means something's loose. Cover panels, duct connections, mounting bolts. Track down what's vibrating and tighten it up. Easy fix most times.\nScreeching or squealing points to bearings going bad in a motor or fan. Bearings aren't made to last forever, especially in the heat of a furnace or in the weather outside. They need replacement before they seize up completely.\nBooming sound when the furnace lights could be delayed ignition. Gas builds up before lighting, then whoosh! This is a dangerous situation. It could be a clogged burner or bad gas valve. Don't ignore this one – it can lead to bigger problems. Schedule furnace repair right away.\nGrinding noises almost always mean something's wearing metal on metal. Shut the system down before parts get damaged beyond repair. Usually it's a motor bearing completely shot, or something's come loose and is hitting the fan. Schedule service and a technician will fix the issue.\n\nThermostat Problems\nSometimes the issue isn't the Carrier unit at all. It's the thermostat telling it what to do.\n\nBatteries die and people forget that some thermostats even have them. The system just stops responding one day. Put in fresh ones every year whether they seem dead or not.\nWiring comes loose, especially in older homes where things settle and shift. Tiny wires connect to little terminal screws inside the thermostat. They work loose and suddenly your AC runs all the time or won't come on at all.\nProgramming gets messed up. People hit buttons without realizing what they've changed. The schedule gets altered or the system gets put in a mode you didn't want. Check your manual for the button instructions to program your system properly and adjust the settings.\n\nFrequent Cycling\nSystem running for just a couple minutes, shutting off, then starting again soon after? That's short cycling. Bad for equipment, bad for comfort, bad for your energy bills.\nOversized units cycle more than properly sized ones. If your Carrier's too big for the space, it cools too quickly, shuts down, then has to start up again soon. Not much to do about this except replace the system with the right size unit when it's time.\nDirty flame sensors make furnaces shut down right after lighting. They can't tell the flame is there, so they shut off the gas as a safety measure. Cleaning that sensor sometimes fixes it. You just need a bit of fine sandpaper and to know where to find the sensor.\nLow refrigerant in AC systems trips the pressure switch. The unit shuts down to protect itself and tries to run again after a while. Round and round it goes. Finding and fixing the leak is the real solution, not just adding more refrigerant.\nCarrier Heat Pumps\nCarrier heat pumps have their own special issues. They cool in summer like an AC but also heat in winter by running the cooling cycle backward. Clever, but more complex.\nReversing valves stick or fail. That's the part that switches between heating and cooling. When it gets stuck, you might have cooling but no heat, or the opposite. Sometimes tapping on the valve body frees it up temporarily, but it'll need replacement eventually.\nDefrost problems show up in winter. The outdoor coil needs to defrost periodically when it's cold out. Ice builds up, and the unit has to melt it off to work right. Defrost control boards fail and leave you with a giant ice block where your heat pump used to be. Not good.\nSchedule heat pump repair service when you encounter heating or cooling problems with your Carrier system.\nDuctwork Matters Too\nThe best Carrier unit in the world won't work right if the ducts are bad. We find this all the time.\nLeaky ducts waste huge amounts of energy. Your expensive conditioned air just dumps into the attic or crawlspace. Sealing those leaks makes the whole system more effective.\nUndersized ducts restrict airflow. Carrier units need the right amount of air moving through them. Too little flow and the AC coil freezes or the furnace overheats. Ductwork that's too small chokes the whole system.\nWhen To Call For Help\nSome Carrier HVAC issues you can handle yourself. Change filters, clean around the outdoor unit, check breakers, change thermostat batteries. Basic maintenance stuff keeps things running right.\nBut when it comes to electrical problems, refrigerant issues, or gas-related furnace problems, that's when calling us makes sense. Our techs work on Carrier systems every day. What takes you hours of frustration (and probably a few trips to the hardware store), we knock out quickly.\nWe keep common Carrier parts on our trucks. Our techs get factory training on all their systems. Plus we stand behind our work with solid guarantees. Your comfort's too important to mess around with trial and error fixes from online videos.\nGive us a call when your Carrier system needs more than the basics. We'll get your home comfortable again without the headache of complex repairs. Too hot, too cold, too noisy - whatever the problem, we've seen it and fixed it countless times before.Are you in need of a Carrier HVAC system to be repaired or maintained?\nMake your appointment with Sears Home Services for a time that works best for you!

It's the thermostat telling it what to do.\n\nBatteries die and people forget that some thermostats even have them. The system just stops responding one day. Put in fresh ones every year whether they seem dead or not.\nWiring comes loose, especially in older homes where things settle and shift. Tiny wires connect to little terminal screws inside the thermostat. They work loose and suddenly your AC runs all the time or won't come on at all.\nProgramming gets messed up. People hit buttons without realizing what they've changed. The schedule gets altered or the system gets put in a mode you didn't want. Check your manual for the button instructions to program your system properly and adjust the settings.\n\nFrequent Cycling\nSystem running for just a couple minutes, shutting off, then starting again soon after? That's short cycling. Bad for equipment, bad for comfort, bad for your energy bills.\nOversized units cycle more than properly sized ones. If your Carrier's too big for the space, it cools too quickly, shuts down, then has to start up again soon. Not much to do about this except replace the system with the right size unit when it's time.\nDirty flame sensors make furnaces shut down right after lighting. They can't tell the flame is there, so they shut off the gas as a safety measure. Cleaning that sensor sometimes fixes it. You just need a bit of fine sandpaper and to know where to find the sensor.\nLow refrigerant in AC systems trips the pressure switch. The unit shuts down to protect itself and tries to run again after a while. Round and round it goes. Finding and fixing the leak is the real solution, not just adding more refrigerant.\nCarrier Heat Pumps\nCarrier heat pumps have their own special issues. They cool in summer like an AC but also heat in winter by running the cooling cycle backward. Clever, but more complex.\nReversing valves stick or fail. That's the part that switches between heating and cooling. When it gets stuck, you might have cooling but no heat, or the opposite. Sometimes tapping on the valve body frees it up temporarily, but it'll need replacement eventually.\nDefrost problems show up in winter. The outdoor coil needs to defrost periodically when it's cold out. Ice builds up, and the unit has to melt it off to work right. Defrost control boards fail and leave you with a giant ice block where your heat pump used to be. Not good.\nSchedule heat pump repair service when you encounter heating or cooling problems with your Carrier system.\nDuctwork Matters Too\nThe best Carrier unit in the world won't work right if the ducts are bad. We find this all the time.\nLeaky ducts waste huge amounts of energy. Your expensive conditioned air just dumps into the attic or crawlspace. Sealing those leaks makes the whole system more effective.\nUndersized ducts restrict airflow. Carrier units need the right amount of air moving through them. Too little flow and the AC coil freezes or the furnace overheats. Ductwork that's too small chokes the whole system.\nWhen To Call For Help\nSome Carrier HVAC issues you can handle yourself. Change filters, clean around the outdoor unit, check breakers, change thermostat batteries. Basic maintenance stuff keeps things running right.\nBut when it comes to electrical problems, refrigerant issues, or gas-related furnace problems, that's when calling us makes sense. Our techs work on Carrier systems every day. What takes you hours of frustration (and probably a few trips to the hardware store), we knock out quickly.\nWe keep common Carrier parts on our trucks. Our techs get factory training on all their systems. Plus we stand behind our work with solid guarantees. Your comfort's too important to mess around with trial and error fixes from online videos.\nGive us a call when your Carrier system needs more than the basics.

        "content": "Carrier HVAC Repair and TroubleshootingWhether it’s your central air conditioner, ductless mini-split, furnace or boiler, Sears Home Services will send a qualified HVAC repair service technician to your home to repair and maintain your Carrier system. We know the importance of keeping your HVAC system maintained and ready to use on a daily basis.\nSears Home Services has been working on Carrier systems for years. Our experienced HVAC techs know these systems inside and out.\nHere a rundown of the common problems that our technicians face when repairing Carrier systems.\nAC Not Cooling Right\nImagine yourself in the middle of summer and your house feels like an oven even with the AC running. We get these calls all day long when the temperature climbs.\nThe first thing to check is your air filter. Sounds too simple, but you wouldn't believe how many service calls come down to a clogged filter. When air can't flow through, the coil gets too cold and freezes up. Now you've got no cooling at all. Change those filters every month during the summer to keep your system running smoothly.\nRefrigerant levels get low over time. Tiny leaks that are hard to spot let that coolant escape bit by bit. Your Carrier might run all day but never get the house comfortable. Low refrigerant also makes the compressor work too hard. It wears it out way faster than normal. Adding refrigerant isn't a DIY job these days. Techs need special licenses and equipment to handle it legally.\nSchedule central air repair service whenever you notice diminished cooling and basic troubleshooting doesn’t fix the problem.\nOutdoor Unit Problems\nCondenser coils get filthy, especially if you've got cottonwood trees in your yard or lots of dust in your area. The outdoor unit can't dump heat properly when those coils get gunked up. The system runs and runs but doesn't cool well. You can spray them gently with a hose, but be careful not to bend the fins. They're real delicate.\nCondenser fan motors burn out from working too hard in the heat. You'll know it's happening when you hear humming but the fan's not turning. Or it starts up then shuts off after a few minutes. The motor's probably overheating. Replacing one takes electrical know-how and the right parts.\nSchedule professional HVAC repair when you notice problems with your outside unit.\nFurnace Won't Light\nCold night and the heat won't kick on. Just great. Carrier furnaces are usually reliable, but they've got their common issues same as any brand.\nGas supply problems happen more than you'd think. Make sure the gas valve's open. Sounds obvious but easy to miss. If someone shut it off and forgot to turn it back on, that's your problem right there.\nIf the igniter cracks or breaks, the gas won't light. Newer Carriers use hot surface igniters instead of pilot lights. They glow orange when working right. If yours isn't lighting up when the furnace tries to start, it's probably shot.\nSchedule gas furnace repair service as soon as you notice an ignition problem that you can’t fix on your own.\nBlower Issues\nBlower motors quit or act up at times on Carrier systems. Maybe it runs but makes noise, or it won't run at the right speed. Bad capacitors cause this a lot. That's the part that gives the motor its initial kick to start spinning. They weaken over time and eventually fail completely.\nLimit switches shut the furnace down if it gets too hot. Safety feature to prevent fires. Problem is, they go bad or get triggered for other reasons. Dirty filters make the furnace run hot, trip that switch. Fix the real problem and the switch stops causing trouble.\nCount on Sears Home Services to get to the bottom of blower issues quickly. Schedule service and we’ll have your Carrier system working properly again in no time.\nStrange Noises\nCarriers aren't usually noisy units when they're running right. New sounds mean something's wrong almost every time.\n\nRattling usually means something's loose. Cover panels, duct connections, mounting bolts. Track down what's vibrating and tighten it up. Easy fix most times.\nScreeching or squealing points to bearings going bad in a motor or fan. Bearings aren't made to last forever, especially in the heat of a furnace or in the weather outside. They need replacement before they seize up completely.\nBooming sound when the furnace lights could be delayed ignition. Gas builds up before lighting, then whoosh! This is a dangerous situation. It could be a clogged burner or bad gas valve. Don't ignore this one – it can lead to bigger problems. Schedule furnace repair right away.\nGrinding noises almost always mean something's wearing metal on metal. Shut the system down before parts get damaged beyond repair. Usually it's a motor bearing completely shot, or something's come loose and is hitting the fan. Schedule service and a technician will fix the issue.\n\nThermostat Problems\nSometimes the issue isn't the Carrier unit at all. It's the thermostat telling it what to do.\n\nBatteries die and people forget that some thermostats even have them. The system just stops responding one day. Put in fresh ones every year whether they seem dead or not.\nWiring comes loose, especially in older homes where things settle and shift.

We know the importance of keeping your HVAC system maintained and ready to use on a daily basis.\\n\\nSears Home Services has been working on Carrier systems for years. Our experienced HVAC techs know these systems inside and out.\\n\\nHere a rundown of the common problems that our technicians face when repairing Carrier systems.\\n\\n## AC Not Cooling Right \\n\\nImagine yourself in the middle of summer and your house feels like an oven even with the AC running. We get these calls all day long when the temperature climbs. \\n\\nThe first thing to check is your air filter. Sounds too simple, but you wouldn't believe how many service calls come down to a clogged filter. When air can't flow through, the coil gets too cold and freezes up. Now you've got no cooling at all. Change those filters every month during the summer to keep your system running smoothly. \\n\\n Refrigerant levels get low over time. Tiny leaks that are hard to spot let that coolant escape bit by bit. Your Carrier might run all day but never get the house comfortable. Low refrigerant also makes the compressor work too hard. It wears it out way faster than normal. Adding refrigerant isn't a DIY job these days. Techs need special licenses and equipment to handle it legally. \\n\\nSchedule [central air repair](/repair/hvac/central-air-conditioner-repair-service) service whenever you notice diminished cooling and basic troubleshooting doesn’t fix the problem.\\n\\n## Outdoor Unit Problems \\n\\nCondenser coils get filthy, especially if you've got cottonwood trees in your yard or lots of dust in your area. The outdoor unit can't dump heat properly when those coils get gunked up. The system runs and runs but doesn't cool well. You can spray them gently with a hose, but be careful not to bend the fins. They're real delicate. \\n\\nCondenser fan motors burn out from working too hard in the heat. You'll know it's happening when you hear humming but the fan's not turning. Or it starts up then shuts off after a few minutes. The motor's probably overheating. Replacing one takes electrical know-how and the right parts. \\n\\nSchedule professional HVAC repair when you notice problems with your outside unit.\\n\\n## Furnace Won't Light \\n\\nCold night and the heat won't kick on. Just great. Carrier furnaces are usually reliable, but they've got their common issues same as any brand. \\n\\nGas supply problems happen more than you'd think. Make sure the gas valve's open. Sounds obvious but easy to miss. If someone shut it off and forgot to turn it back on, that's your problem right there. \\n\\nIf the igniter cracks or breaks, the gas won't light. Newer Carriers use hot surface igniters instead of pilot lights. They glow orange when working right. If yours isn't lighting up when the furnace tries to start, it's probably shot. \\n\\nSchedule [gas furnace repair service](/repair/hvac/gas-furnace-repair-service) as soon as you notice an ignition problem that you can’t fix on your own.\\n\\n## Blower Issues \\n\\nBlower motors quit or act up at times on Carrier systems. Maybe it runs but makes noise, or it won't run at the right speed. Bad capacitors cause this a lot. That's the part that gives the motor its initial kick to start spinning. They weaken over time and eventually fail completely. \\n\\nLimit switches shut the furnace down if it gets too hot. Safety feature to prevent fires. Problem is, they go bad or get triggered for other reasons. Dirty filters make the furnace run hot, trip that switch. Fix the real problem and the switch stops causing trouble. \\n\\nCount on Sears Home Services to get to the bottom of blower issues quickly. Schedule service and we’ll have your Carrier system working properly again in no time.\\n\\n## Strange Noises \\n\\nCarriers aren't usually noisy units when they're running right. New sounds mean something's wrong almost every time. \\n\\n* Rattling usually means something's loose. Cover panels, duct connections, mounting bolts. Track down what's vibrating and tighten it up. Easy fix most times. \\n* Screeching or squealing points to bearings going bad in a motor or fan. Bearings aren't made to last forever, especially in the heat of a furnace or in the weather outside. They need replacement before they seize up completely.\\n* Booming sound when the furnace lights could be delayed ignition. Gas builds up before lighting, then whoosh! This is a dangerous situation. It could be a clogged burner or bad gas valve. Don't ignore this one – it can lead to bigger problems. Schedule furnace repair right away.\\n* Grinding noises almost always mean something's wearing metal on metal. Shut the system down before parts get damaged beyond repair. Usually it's a motor bearing completely shot, or something's come loose and is hitting the fan. Schedule service and a technician will fix the issue.\\n\\n## Thermostat Problems \\n\\nSometimes the issue isn't the Carrier unit at all. It's the thermostat telling it what to do. \\n\\n* Batteries die and people forget that some thermostats even have them. The system just stops responding one day. Put in fresh ones every year whether they seem dead or not. \\n* Wiring comes loose, especially in older homes where things settle and shift. Tiny wires connect to little terminal screws inside the thermostat. They work loose and suddenly your AC runs all the time or won't come on at all. \\n* Programming gets messed up. People hit buttons without realizing what they've changed. The schedule gets altered or the system gets put in a mode you didn't want. Check your manual for the button instructions to program your system properly and adjust the settings. \\n\\n## Frequent Cycling \\n\\nSystem running for just a couple minutes, shutting off, then starting again soon after? That's short cycling. Bad for equipment, bad for comfort, bad for your energy bills. \\n\\nOversized units cycle more than properly sized ones. If your Carrier's too big for the space, it cools too quickly, shuts down, then has to start up again soon. Not much to do about this except replace the system with the right size unit when it's time. \\n\\nDirty flame sensors make furnaces shut down right after lighting. They can't tell the flame is there, so they shut off the gas as a safety measure. Cleaning that sensor sometimes fixes it. You just need a bit of fine sandpaper and to know where to find the sensor. \\n\\nLow refrigerant in AC systems trips the pressure switch. The unit shuts down to protect itself and tries to run again after a while. Round and round it goes. Finding and fixing the leak is the real solution, not just adding more refrigerant. \\n\\n## Carrier Heat Pumps \\n\\nCarrier heat pumps have their own special issues. They cool in summer like an AC but also heat in winter by running the cooling cycle backward. Clever, but more complex. \\n\\nReversing valves stick or fail. That's the part that switches between heating and cooling. When it gets stuck, you might have cooling but no heat, or the opposite. Sometimes tapping on the valve body frees it up temporarily, but it'll need replacement eventually. \\n\\nDefrost problems show up in winter. The outdoor coil needs to defrost periodically when it's cold out. Ice builds up, and the unit has to melt it off to work right. Defrost control boards fail and leave you with a giant ice block where your heat pump used to be. Not good. \\n\\nSchedule [heat pump repair](/repair/hvac/heat-pump-repair-service) service when you encounter heating or cooling problems with your Carrier system.\\n\\n## Ductwork Matters Too \\n\\nThe best Carrier unit in the world won't work right if the ducts are bad. We find this all the time. \\n\\nLeaky ducts waste huge amounts of energy. Your expensive conditioned air just dumps into the attic or crawlspace. Sealing those leaks makes the whole system more effective. \\n\\nUndersized ducts restrict airflow. Carrier units need the right amount of air moving through them. Too little flow and the AC coil freezes or the furnace overheats. Ductwork that's too small chokes the whole system. \\n\\n## When To Call For Help \\n\\nSome Carrier HVAC issues you can handle yourself. Change filters, clean around the outdoor unit, check breakers, change thermostat batteries. Basic maintenance stuff keeps things running right. \\n\\nBut when it comes to electrical problems, refrigerant issues, or gas-related furnace problems, that's when calling us makes sense. Our techs work on Carrier systems every day. What takes you hours of frustration (and probably a few trips to the hardware store), we knock out quickly. \\n\\nWe keep common Carrier parts on our trucks. Our techs get factory training on all their systems. Plus we stand behind our work with solid guarantees. Your comfort's too important to mess around with trial and error fixes from online videos. \\n\\nGive us a call when your Carrier system needs more than the basics. We'll get your home comfortable again without the headache of complex repairs. Too hot, too cold, too noisy - whatever the problem, we've seen it and fixed it countless times before.\\n\"])",

Unblocking air vents may fix the cooling problem in your fridge.\\n\\nHigh fridge temperatures are also a sign of control system problems, a failure in the air control damper, low refrigerant charge and other malfunctions. Follow the DIY troubleshooting tips in these videos to restore proper cooling in your refrigerator:\\n\\n* [Troubleshooting a refrigerator not cooling video](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/article/troubleshooting-a-refrigerator-not-cooling-video)\\n* [Diagnosing refrigerator evaporator fan problems video](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/article/diagnosing-refrigerator-evaporator-fan-problems-video)\\n* [Diagnosing refrigerator thermistor problems video](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/article/diagnosing-refrigerator-thermistor-problems-video)\\n* [Troubleshooting defrost system problems video](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/article/refrigerator-wont-cool-troubleshooting-video-defrost-system-problems)\\n\\nThese expert tips may help you fix the refrigerator cooling problem. If not, [schedule refrigerator repair service](/repair/refrigerator-repair-service) and we’ll send a Sears Technician to your home to fix the fridge.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Won’t Power Up\\n\\nWhen you find the fridge completely dead, check the control to make sure the fridge is turned on. If that doesn’t fix the problem, check the house circuit breaker for your fridge. Reset the circuit breaker in case it has tripped.\\n\\nIf the fridge won’t power up after resetting the house circuit breaker, check the electrical outlet. Make sure the refrigerator outlet cord is securely plugged in. \\n\\nIf the outlet cord is plugged in, test the electrical outlet by plugging in a lamp or other small appliance to verify that the outlet is working.\\n\\nIf the outlet has no power, have an electrician fix the outlet.\\n\\nIf the outlet works, check the refrigerator power cord for damage. Replace the power cord if you find damage.\\n\\nIf the outlet cord is good, then a failed electronic control board or bad control panel could be causing the problem. These parts are expensive. You’ll likely need to [have a service technician diagnose and repair the fridge](/repair) if basic troubleshooting doesn’t help you find the cause of the failure.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Excessive Frost in the Freezer\\n\\nWhen snowy frost coats items in the freezer, check for loose spots or damage in the door gaskets that could be letting in warm, moist air. That moist air will cause the excessive frost in the freezer compartment.\\n\\nYou may be able to fix the problem by pushing a loose door gasket back into its channel. If you find a torn or damaged door gasket, you’ll need to replace it.

Check to see if the ice dispenser door closes properly. Remove a stuck ice cube if that’s what you find keeping the door from closing. Replace the ice dispenser door flap if it’s damaged or broken.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Ice Maker Not Working\\n\\n Several problems can prevent ice production in the freezer or ice compartment. The ice maker could be jammed or broken, a dirty water filter or kinked water line could be blocking water flow or the water inlet valve could be clogged or faulty. A control board problem can also kill ice production.\\n\\nBecause many ice makers are controlled by electronic circuit boards, you can sometimes fix the problem by shutting off the ice maker then turning it back on. If that doesn’t fix the ice maker, disconnect power to the entire fridge for several minutes to reset all circuit boards in the refrigerator. Power the refrigerator back up and see if the ice maker works. If it does, then you’ve likely fixed the problem.\\n\\nIf this initial repair tip didn’t fix the ice maker, try these additional troubleshooting steps:\\n\\n* Check the ice maker for jammed cubes and clear any ice buildup that you find.\\n* See if the refrigerator water dispenser works. If not, replace the water filter. If that doesn’t help restore water flow, then you’ll likely need to [replace the water valve](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/repair-guide/how-to-replace-the-water-inlet-valve-in-a-top-freezer-refrigerator) if it's clogged or won't fill the ice maker when activated. \\n* No ice in the ice maker also could mean that your refrigerator isn't cooling-the ice maker won't cycle if the freezer is warmer than 5 degrees F. Check freezer temperature and fix the cooling problem if the freezer isn’t cooling properly.\\n\\nIf these troubleshooting steps don’t help you fix the ice maker, you’ll likely need to [have a service technician diagnose and repair the failure](/repair).\\n\\n---\\n\\n![Image of woman viewing refrigerator error code](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/tCi9c00N5eiW1t5ahEenu/9e301e1288e76ec3d9d8c43276dae716/Image_of_woman_viewing_refrigerator_error_code.jpg)\\n\\n## Refrigerator Displays an Error Code\\n\\nMany refrigerators have an electronic control board that detect failures for you and display and error code on the control panel. You can quickly figure out what’s wrong with this type of fridge—as long as you can crack the code. \\n\\nWhen you see a code displayed on the control panel of your refrigerator, use our [Refrigerator Error Code Charts](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/error-codes/refrigerator-repair/1234589) to determine the cause of the code and get DIY troubleshooting tips to fix your fridge.\\n\\nAt some point, you may find that you’re unable to complete the error code troubleshooting, or you’re unable to determine the cause of the failure after following the repair steps listed for an error code. In that situation, you’ll likely need to have a service technician diagnose and repair your fridge.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## When to Replace Your Fridge Instead of Repairing It\\n\\nWhen your refrigerator is over 10 years old and a repair is going to cost you half as much as buying a new fridge, then it’s typically time to replace the refrigerator instead of repairing it.\\n\\n![Upgrade You Appliances Image](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/29MiEr9HvIZJDc3QyipZ3Z/1adb7ce2ad6e29187f35920f2612929b/Upgrade_You_Appliances_Image.png)\\n\\nWhen the time comes to replace your fridge, or all of your kitchen appliances, [visit our Sears.com website](https://www.sears.com) to easily select the products you need and get help with financing.\\n\\nEfficient and durable appliances help make a house a home.

Windows are designed to maximize energy savings by minimizing air leakage and improving thermal performance. Low-emissivity (low-E) coatings are often applied to the glass, reflecting heat back into the room during winter and blocking solar heat gain during summer. Additionally, advanced weatherstripping and sealing techniques ensure a tight seal, preventing air infiltration and boosting overall energy efficiency.\\n\\nWith these advancements in glass technology, improved insulation capabilities, and energy-efficient features, windows in 2026 are truly better than ever. They not only enhance the aesthetics of your home but also provide superior performance, energy savings, and comfort. If you're wondering if it's time to replace your windows, now is the perfect time to take advantage of the latest innovations in window technology.\\n\\n![window improvements](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/13w445EKteJCDygFQ6mTLa/efde1b9a7f3b31992566149202e1210e/window_improvements.jpg)\\n\\n## Boosting Home Security with Modern Windows\\n\\nWindows play a crucial role in home security, and thanks to technological advancements, they now offer enhanced protection for your home.\\n\\nOne of the latest security features in windows is the use of impact-resistant materials. These materials can withstand the force of potential break-ins, ensuring that intruders have a hard time gaining access to your home. Investing in windows made from impact-resistant materials provides peace of mind, knowing your home is secure.\\n\\nApart from impact-resistant materials, advanced locking mechanisms are another key aspect of enhanced home security. Modern windows come equipped with state-of-the-art locking systems that provide an extra layer of protection. These locks are designed to be tamper-proof and difficult to pick, making it extremely challenging for intruders to break into your home through the windows.\\n\\nChoosing windows with the latest security features significantly enhances the safety of your home. These windows not only protect against potential break-ins but also deter criminals from attempting to enter your property. Understanding windows with security features can help you choose the right windows for your home, ensuring your family and belongings are well-protected.\\n\\n## Improved Noise Reduction: The Key to a Peaceful Home\\n\\nNoise reduction is a critical consideration when selecting windows for your home. Nobody wants to be disturbed by the sounds of traffic, construction, or noisy neighbors. That's why modern windows are designed with improved noise reduction technology to provide a quieter and more peaceful living environment.\\n\\nOne of the key features contributing to enhanced noise reduction is soundproofing technology. This technology uses specialized materials and construction techniques to minimize sound transmission through the windows. By blocking out external noise, soundproof windows create a serene indoor atmosphere where you can relax and enjoy your surroundings without distractions.\\n\\nDouble or triple pane windows also significantly improve noise reduction. These windows consist of multiple layers of glass with insulating gas in between, creating an extra barrier against sound infiltration. The additional layers and gas fill help to absorb and dampen sound waves, resulting in a quieter interior.\\n\\nTo determine the effectiveness of windows in reducing noise, refer to their noise reduction ratings. This rating, often expressed in decibels (dB), indicates how much sound the windows can block. The higher the noise reduction rating, the better the windows are at reducing noise. Choose windows with high noise reduction ratings for maximum tranquility in your home.\\n\\nTop window replacement contractors offer a wide range of windows that incorporate the latest noise reduction technologies. Choose the best windows for your needs, considering factors such as location, noise levels, and personal preferences. Experience the benefits of improved noise reduction in your home with high-quality windows.\\n\\n## Energy Efficiency: A Top Priority in New Windows\\n\\nFor homeowners, energy efficiency is a top priority when it comes to windows. In 2026, windows are excelling in saving energy and reducing utility costs.

By preventing excessive heat gain during hot summer months and heat loss during colder seasons, these energy-saving coatings help maintain a comfortable indoor temperature year-round.\\n- Low-emissivity (Low-E) glass: Low-E glass is a significant development in window technology. This glass has a special coating that reflects heat back into the room, reducing heat loss through the window. By keeping the heat inside during winter and blocking heat from entering during summer, Low-E glass helps minimize the need for heating and cooling, leading to reduced energy consumption and lower utility bills.\\n- Insulated frames and sashes: Windows with insulated frames and sashes provide enhanced thermal performance. These frames and sashes are designed with materials that have low thermal conductivity, reducing heat transfer between the interior and exterior of the home. By minimizing thermal bridging, insulated frames and sashes help maintain a consistent indoor temperature and decrease the energy required to heat or cool a home.\\n\\nBy investing in windows with energy-saving coatings, Low-E glass, and insulated frames and sashes, homeowners can significantly improve the energy efficiency of their homes. Not only do these advancements lead to lower utility bills, but they also create a more comfortable living environment year-round. Window contractors often offer a wide range of windows that incorporate these energy-efficient features. \\n\\n## Durability: A Key Feature of Replacement Windows\\n\\nDurability is a key consideration when choosing new windows for your home. Thanks to technological advancements, windows now offer superior durability than ever before. Here are three ways in which windows have been enhanced to offer long-lasting performance:\\n\\n1. High-quality window materials: Today's windows are made with top-quality materials designed to be strong, sturdy, and resistant to wear and tear. Be it vinyl, fiberglass, or aluminum windows, you can trust them to stand the test of time.\\n\\n2. Resistance to weather elements: Windows are constantly exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain, wind, and extreme temperatures. The latest windows are engineered to resist these elements, preventing water leaks, drafts, and heat loss. With improved insulation and sealing, these windows provide a barrier against the elements, keeping your home comfortable and protected.\\n\\n3. Long-lasting performance: Investing in high-quality windows means investing in long-lasting performance. Modern windows are built to meet stringent quality standards, ensuring they will continue to function optimally for years to come. With proper maintenance, your windows will maintain their performance and appearance, adding value to your home.\\n\\nIt's crucial understand the importance of durable windows. Most window replacement contractors offer a wide selection of top-quality windows that are built to last. A team of experts from the service provider that you choose can help you select the right windows for your home and ensure professional installation. By making the right decisions on window replacement, you can trust that your windows will stand the test of time.\\n\\n## Improve Your Home's Aesthetics with New Windows\\n\\nWindows play a significant role in enhancing the overall look and feel of your home. Window manufacturers constantly upgrade and improve their products. In 2026, windows are continuing to undergo remarkable transformations, offering sleek and modern designs that seamlessly blend with any architectural style.\\n\\nOne standout feature of modern window designs is their sleekness. With clean lines and minimalist frames, these windows create a contemporary and sophisticated appeal. They provide a seamless transition between the interior and exterior of your home, allowing natural light to flood in while offering unobstructed views of the outside world.\\n\\nMoreover, modern windows offer a wide range of customizable options to suit your specific preferences and needs. Whether you prefer casement, double-hung, or sliding windows, you can find the perfect style that complements your home's architecture. Additionally, you can choose from various glass options, such as frosted or tinted glass, to enhance privacy and energy efficiency.\\n\\nAnother area where modern windows excel is the variety of color choices available. No longer are you limited to traditional white or beige frames. Now, you can select from an extensive palette of colors to match your home's exterior or interior decor. Whether you prefer bold and vibrant hues or subtle and understated shades, there is a color option to suit every taste.\\n\"])",

An HVAC unit is a major home investment, and if something goes wrong, you want to be sure you’re protected.\\n\\nWhether you’re [buying a furnace](/repair/hvac/gas-furnace-repair-service), a new air conditioning unit or a whole-house system, check the warranty, and talk to your contractor or vendor about what you can expect in the HVAC terms of service. Make sure you go with a provider whose coverage supports the level of investment you’re making.\\n\\nWhen reviewing warranties keep the following in mind.\\n\\n## HVAC System Warranty Duration\\n\\nHeating and cooling units can be costly to repair, so you’ll probably want to find the longest-term warranty available. Keep in mind that many HVAC service agreements have varying time frames for different parts. For example, 10 years for parts and 20 years for a heat exchanger is good.\\n\\n## Conditions for Use Covered by the Warranty\\n\\nAll warranties have conditions under which they are valid, which often relate back to who bought the unit. Some are void once the home changes ownership.\\n\\nMany warranties also require the unit to be registered within 90 days of installation to be valid.\\n\\n## Things That Might Invalidate Your Warranty\\n\\nEven a lifetime warranty can be voided if you don’t follow the rules. Many HVAC warranties require proof that the unit has been properly maintained with [routine annual HVAC system maintenance](/maintain/heating-cooling-maintenance) — so make sure to schedule checkups and keep the paperwork somewhere safe.\\n\\nOther warranties may be invalidated on day one if a certified contractor does not install the unit. Before you plan to install it yourself, make sure you read the fine print.\\n\\n## Labor Costs Not Covered by the Warranty\\n\\nEven if you have a lifetime warranty, you may still get stuck with labor costs. Most warranties only cover labor for the first year, though some brands allow you to purchase extended HVAC labor warranties.\\n\\nProtect yourself: The Sears Home Services [Sears Protect Home Warranty Plan](/home-warranty) includes two free HVAC maintenance checks every year.\"])",

Here's what you need to know:\\n\\nThe lifespan of an appliance can vary, but here are some ballpark figures:\\n\\n* Refrigerators: Generally, refrigerators last between 10 to 15 years.\\n* Dishwashers: Dishwashers usually last around 7 to 12 years.\\n* Washing machines: Depending on their usage, washing machines can go strong for 8 to 12 years.\\n* Dryers: Dryers have a similar lifespan to washing machines, lasting approximately 8 to 12 years.\\n* Ovens and ranges: These appliances can last anywhere from 10 to 20 years.\\n\\nSeveral factors can influence the lifespan of your appliances. These include:\\n\\n* Quality of the appliance: Better-quality appliances generally last longer.\\n* Usage and maintenance: Regular maintenance and correct usage can prolong the lifespan of your appliances.\\n* Environmental conditions: Extreme temperatures, humidity, and other environmental elements can affect appliance performance and durability.\\n\\nIf you notice any of the following signs, it might be time to think about replacing your appliance:\\n\\n* Regular breakdowns and repairs.\\n* Subpar performance, such as not cooling or heating efficiently.\\n* Unusual noises or smells.\\n* Outdated technology or lack of energy efficiency.\\n\\nKeep in mind that these are just rough guidelines, and your individual appliance's lifespan may vary. If you're uncertain about whether to repair or replace, don't hesitate to consult with a professional technician who can provide expert advice based on your unique situation.\\n\\n## Repair vs. Replace: The Big Decision\\n\\nIf your appliance isn't working as it should, deciding whether to repair or replace it can be challenging. Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of repairs is a key step in this decision-making process.\\n\\nConsider the appliance's age and condition. Older appliances may be more susceptible to breakdowns and may not be worth repairing, especially if the cost of repairs exceeds the value of the appliance. Also, if the appliance has a history of frequent repairs, it might be more economical to replace it with a newer, more reliable model.\\n\\nAnother factor to ponder is when replacement might be a better option than repair. If your appliance has significant structural or functional issues, such as a faulty compressor in a refrigerator or a burned-out motor in a washing machine, it might be more practical to invest in a new appliance rather than spend money on extensive repairs.\\n\\nWarranty and service plans also play a role in making repair decisions. If your appliance is still under warranty or a service plan, it might be more cost-effective to get it repaired rather than replaced. However, if the warranty has expired or the service plan doesn't cover the necessary repairs, replacing the appliance might be the smarter choice.\\n\\nIn the end, the decision to repair or replace an appliance depends on several factors, including cost-effectiveness, age, condition, and warranty coverage. Consulting with a professional technician can offer valuable insights and suggestions based on your specific situation.\\n\\n## Assessing Energy Efficiency\\n\\nEnergy efficiency is a key factor to consider when thinking about replacing your appliances. Energy-efficient appliances not only save you money on utility bills, they also contribute to a sustainable future.\\n\\nTo assess the energy efficiency of your appliances, look for their energy efficiency ratings. In the US, the Energy Star label is the most common rating system. Appliances with the Energy Star label meet the strict energy efficiency guidelines set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Energy (DOE).\\n\\nUpgrading to more energy-efficient appliances comes with several benefits. Firstly, these appliances use less energy, which means lower energy bills. Over time, the savings can be substantial. Additionally, energy-efficient appliances help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thus reducing your carbon footprint. They often come with advanced features and technologies that can enhance your overall user experience.\\n\\nAt Sears, we offer a wide range of energy-efficient appliances that can help you save both energy and money. Our experts can assist you in selecting the right appliances for your home, ensuring you make an informed decision.

Proper disposal of old appliances, reducing environmental impact through responsible appliance replacement, and exploring eco-friendly options for appliance upgrades are all vital factors to consider.\\n\\nProper disposal methods for old appliances are important to prevent them from ending up in landfills and contributing to pollution. Instead of simply tossing them, consider recycling. Many appliance manufacturers and retailers offer recycling programs where you can drop off your old appliances for proper disposal.
