Is it making strange sounds or vibrations? These are just a couple of the most common washer problems that Sears’ extensive network of technicians solve on a daily basis. In fact, [Sears Home Services](/repair) has a long-standing reputation for expertly repairing countless washing machines year after year, ensuring reliability and peace of mind for homeowners.\\n\\nIf your washer’s on the fritz, you’re likely seeing one of these common washing machine problems.\\n\\n### Problem #1: Unusual Sounds or Vibrations\\n\\n**Likely Culprit**: Damaged tub bearings due to a compromised seal.\\n  - **DIY Fixes**: Check for an unbalanced load and redistribute the load to eliminate banging and vibration noises. If the load is too large, remove some garments and spin them separately.\\n  - **Technician Needed**: Replacing tub bearings is a complex process that requires disassembling parts of the machine, best handled by a [washer repair](/repair/washer-repair-service) professional.\\n\\n### Problem #2: Washer Fails to Run or Stops Mid-Cycle\\n**Likely Culprit**: A faulty door or lid switch.\\n  - **DIY Fixes**: Ensure the door or lid is closing properly. Remove any obstructions that are preventing the door or lid from closing. \\n  - **Technician Needed**: If the switch is defective and there's no continuity, replacing the door or lid switch requires electrical work best performed by a skilled technician.\\n\\n### Problem #3: Water Doesn’t Drain\\n**Likely Culprit**: The drain pump might be due for replacement or obstructed.\\n  - **DIY Fixes**: Inspect the house drain for the washer to see if water drains properly through the stand pipe. If not, clear the stand pipe with a plumber’s snake or call a plumber to clear the drain. Check the drain hose for kinks or blockages. Clear clogs from the washer drain hose using a wet/dry shop vacuum if necessary.\\n  - **Technician Needed**: If the pump is damaged or fails to operate after removing obstructions, a technician should replace it.\\n\\n### Problem #4: Washer Doesn’t Fill\\n**Likely Culprit**: The fill valve assembly may be defective and needs replacing.\\n  - **DIY Fixes**: Check the water supply faucets behind the washer to make sure that they’re open. Turn off the water supply faucets and disconnect the water fill hoses from the back of the washer and place the hose ends in a bucket. Open the faucets and check for flow through the fill hoses. Have a plumber fix the washer water supply if no water flows through the fill hoses.\\n  - **Technician Needed**: If the water fill valve assembly doesn’t work, a technician should replace it to make sure that water hoses and wiring is connected to the replacement part properly.\\n\\n### Problem #5: The Basket Is Slow or Fails to Spin\\n**Likely Culprit**: A failing motor coupler, possibly due to frequent overloading.\\n  - **DIY Fixes**: Reduce load sizes to prevent overloading.\\n  - **Technician Needed**: Replacing a motor coupler involves accessing the motor and transmission, requiring specialized knowledge and tools.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Trust Sears Home Services for Expert Washer Repairs\\n\\nWhile some issues may have straightforward DIY fixes, most require the expertise and tools available only to professional technicians.

Replace the drain hose if it’s cracked or damaged.\\n\\nCheck for a clogged house drain for the washer. Water will back up and leak out of the stand pipe if the house drain is clogged. Clear the house drain for the washer using a plumber’s snake if the drain is clogged.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![check-the-washing-machine-door-boot-seal](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/51J735jq43j5T0bOSD34FQ/7e98c440aa83b564ddd0cc650a511362/check-front-load-washer-door-boot-seal.png)\\n\\n## Check the door and door boot seal on a front-load washer\\n\\nA damaged door, door lock or door boot seal could cause a front-load washer to leak water. \\n\\nCheck to see if the door closes properly. Check the strike on the door and see if it keeps the door shut properly. If you find problems, replace any damaged components.\\n\\nHere’s a DIY repair video that shows how to replace a door lock assembly on a front-load washing machine:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zTDrlxdf9ew\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nA torn or damaged door boot seal is another common cause of washer leaks. \\n\\nExamine the door seal for tears or damage. Check in between the folds of the door boot because the folds can hide a tear or damage.\\n\\nReplace the door boot seal if it’s damaged. Here’s a video that shows how to replace the door boot seal on a common type of front-load washer:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/90GS3AoBlTc\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nReplacing the door boot on a front-load washer is a fairly advanced repair. If you’re not completely confident that you can safely and effectively replace the door boot on your own, schedule [washer repair]() service and we’ll send a Sears Home Services technician to your home to replace the door boot for you.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Look for excessive suds\\n\\nOverdosing the washer with detergent or using the wrong kind of detergent can cause excessive suds to form during the cycle. The suds can overflow the tub or push out through the washer vent on a front load washer. Overflowing suds eventually dissipates as water on the floor around the washer. \\n\\nCheck the clothes inside the washer for suds and soap residue. If you see signs of oversudsing inside your washer, you may be using too much detergent or you could be using non-HE laundry detergent in an HE (High Efficiency) washer. \\n\\nIf you’re using non-HE detergent in an HE washer, switch detergents to an HE version. You’ll see the HE logo on HE detergent containers. You need to use HE detergent in HE washers because HE detergent is specially designed to create less suds while getting the clothes clean in a low water usage washer.\\n\\nIf you’re using the right laundry detergent in your washer and seeing excessive suds, use less detergent. In an HE washer, you typically won’t need to use more than a tablespoon of detergent to clean most loads.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![check-the-washing-machine-dispenser-drawer](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/8TwJ2OiosSI1t6K3aQPur/73c97d03778c87878f7d221c179881cb/check-the-washer-dispenser-drawer.png)\\n\\n## Check the detergent dispenser\\n\\nA clogged detergent dispenser can cause a leak. Check the detergent dispenser and clean it if you find that it’s clogged.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Leaking Water Inlet Valves\\n\\nGrit or debris can get past the inlet water screens and wind up preventing an inlet water valve from closing fully. If you find the washer tub overflowing, you likely have a water valve that is stuck partially open.\\n\\nDrain water out of the washer using a wet/dry shop vacuum. If it’s safe to plug the washing machine back in because there isn’t any water on the floor around the washer’s electrical outlet, you can use the washer drain pump to evacuate the water by running a Drain \\u0026 Spin cycle. Unplug the washer after using that cycle if the floor around the washer is still wet.\\n\\nReplace the water inlet valve assembly if a water valve is leaking and water constantly fills the washer even when it’s off.\\n\\nHere’s a video that shows how to replace the inlet water valve assembly on a common type of front-load washer:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TfRchiKiOAY\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nThis video shows how to replace the water inlet valve assembly on a common top-load washer:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MR5uNFBsatA\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Have a Sears Home Services Technician find and fix the leak\\n\\nWhen you’re unable to find and fix the cause of the washing machine leak on your own, schedule [washer repair](/repair/washer-repair-service) to have a Sears Home Services technician fix the washing machine.

In this article, we’ll take a closer look at how the water level pressure switch works, why it’s essential, and how it impacts your washing machine’s performance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![washing-machine-water-level-pressure-switch](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/6gOI1x17VOR28oI2XUuNL3/5828e492dca9d2ecdc5f6bdd8272eacf/washing-machine-pressure-switch-image.png)\\n\\n## What is a Water Level Pressure Switch?\\n\\nThe water level pressure switch is a small but critical part of a washing machine’s control system. It senses the water level in the washer tub and sends signals to the machine’s control board, dictating whether it should stop or continue filling the tub. This sensor is typically a small round component located inside the machine, with a long, thin air tube connected to the bottom of the washer tub.\\n\\nThe pressure switch serves as the washing machine’s “eyes” on the water level, ensuring the machine uses just the right amount of water for each load. Using too much or too little water can affect washing efficiency, so the pressure switch helps maintain the correct balance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How Does a Pressure Switch Work?\\n\\nThe water level pressure switch works by detecting the air pressure changes in the washer’s air tube as water fills the tub. Here’s a breakdown of the process:\\n\\n* __Air Tube Connection:__ The water level pressure switch is connected to the bottom of the washer tub by an air tube. As the tub fills with water, it compresses the air inside this tube.\\n* __Air Pressure Build-Up Moves the Pressure Switch Diaphragm:__ As more water enters the tub, the air in the tube gets more compressed, increasing the air pressure within the tube. The air pressure pushes up on the sensing diaphram inside the pressure switch.\\n* __Pressure Switch Activation:__ When the air pressure reaches a certain point to indicate the tub is full, it pushes the diaphragm up against an electrical switch contact that stops the filling process by shutting off electrical current to the water fill valves. This pressure level is calibrated to correspond with the desired water level for the washer.\\n* __Signaling the Control Board:__ When the washer has an electronic control board, once the switch detects the appropriate pressure, it sends a signal to the washing machine’s control board to stop filling the tub. \\n* __The Pressure Switch Resets During the Drain Process:__ The switch remains in a “closed” position while the machine continues with the wash cycle. It then resets during the drain routine for the next water fill.\\n\\nThis air-pressure system is both accurate and reliable, helping the machine avoid underfilling or overfilling the tub.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Types of Water Level Pressure Switches\\n\\nDifferent washing machines use various types of water level pressure switches depending on their design. Here are the common types:\\n\\n* __Mechanical Pressure Switches:__ These use a physical diaphragm that moves when air pressure builds up. This movement opens or closes electrical contacts, sending signals to the control board.\\n* __Electronic Pressure Sensors:__ Some modern washing machines use electronic sensors that measure air pressure with more precision, providing more accurate water level control. An electronic washer water level pressure sensor (also called a water level pressure transducer) works in a similar manner to a water level pressure sensor but a transducer creates an electronic signal instead of activating an internal switch in the component. As the washer fills with water, air in the sensor air tube pushes up on the diaphragm and moves a rod or piston inside of a core in the transducer to create an electronic signal that is sensed by the control board to control water level in the washer tub. The electronic control board stops filling the washer and advances to the wash cycle when it senses that the washer tub is full based on the signal from the water level pressure transducer.\\n* __Variable Water Level Sensors:__ These are designed for machines with multiple water level settings. They can detect specific pressure changes, enabling various levels based on load size and cycle type.\\n\\nRegardless of the type, each switch follows the same general principle of measuring air pressure to control water levels accurately.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why is the Water Level Pressure Switch Important?\\n\\nThe water level pressure switch is essential for multiple reasons:\\n\\n* __Prevents Overflows:__ By stopping water intake at the correct level, the pressure switch helps prevent overflows and potential water damage.\\n* __Saves Water and Energy:__ The switch ensures the washing machine only uses the amount of water necessary for each load, conserving water and energy.\\n* __Enhances Cleaning Efficiency:__ Correct water levels are crucial for optimal washing performance. Too little water can lead to ineffective cleaning, while too much water can dilute detergent, reducing its effectiveness.\\n* __Protects the Machine:__ The pressure switch prevents excess water from entering the tub, which could strain internal components, such as the motor, or cause electrical issues.\\n\\nUnderstanding the role of the pressure switch can help you recognize the importance of water levels in achieving clean, well-rinsed laundry.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Troubleshooting Water Level Pressure Switch Issues\\n\\n### Symptoms of a Faulty Pressure Switch\\n\\nIf the pressure switch malfunctions, you might encounter a few noticeable issues. Here are some signs that the water level pressure switch may be faulty:\\n\\n* __Overflowing Tub:__ If the switch fails to signal the control board, the tub may overfill, leading to potential spills and flooding.\\n* __Insufficient Water Level:__ A malfunctioning switch might also prematurely signal the machine to stop filling, leading to lower-than-required water levels and ineffective washing.\\n* __Error Codes on Digital Machines:__ Many newer washing machines have error codes that will display on the control panel if the water level pressure switch isn’t functioning correctly.\\n\\n### How to Troubleshoot Pressure Switch Problems\\n\\nHere are some practical troubleshooting steps that you can take when you notice pressure switch problems in your washer.\\n\\n#### Check the Air Tube\\n\\nOver time, the air tube can become kinked or clogged, preventing the pressure from building up properly. It can also get cracked or damaged. Inspect the air tube for any obstructions or signs of leaks or damage. Make sure it’s properly connected to the pressure switch and the bottom of the washer tub.\\n\\n#### Inspect the Switch\\n\\nIf you’re comfortable with attempting safe DIY repairs, unplug the washer and open the console or the top panel of the washer to access the pressure switch. Check the wire harness connections on the pressure switch and control. Reconnect any loose wires harness connection and repair any broken or damaged wires.\\n\\nHere’s a helpful DIY video that shows how to fix damaged wires:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CGvOheMLsrA\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nIf the wiring connections are okay and you’re advanced DIY’er, you can find the tech sheet for your washer and use the diagnostic tests recommended in that document to safely test the internal contacts of the pressure switch.\\n\\nIf you’re unable to find and fix the pressure switch problem yourself, schedule [washer repair]() service and we’ll send a Sears Home Services technician to your home to fix the issue.\\n\\n#### Consult the Manual or Error Code Charts\\n\\nFor modern machines, the owner’s manual will often have troubleshooting tips or diagnostic modes to help you identify problems related to the pressure switch.

Our YouTube playlist is loaded with solutions to the most common problems.**\\n\\nIn the most popular video series on our YouTube channel, the pros at Sears Home Services share their best [washer troubleshooting tips](/blog/top-4-reasons-your-washing-machine-wont-drain-or-spin) for common problems plaguing top-loading washers.\\n\\nOftentimes, there’s a simple fix that you can do yourself that can save you from having to have a [washer repair service](/repair/washer-repair-service) call.\\n\\nHere’s a list of our best top-load washer troubleshooting video tips.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What to Do When Your Top-Load Washer is Leaking Water\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I5JJOxkUcjA?rel=0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n**The problem:** \\n\\nYou notice water on the floor of your laundry room. Answer these questions before scheduling a washer repair service call:\\n\\n### Are the fill hoses installed properly?\\n\\nCheck the fill hose connections to make sure they’re secure. If they're loose, you may find them leaking. Even a small drip will build up on the laundry room floor quickly and appear as a leak from the bottom of the washer.\\n\\nAlso, check the washer fill faucets for leaks. A bad faucet seal could be causing the leak.\\n\\n### Is the washer drain hose installed properly?\\n\\nCheck the drain hose. Make sure that it's installed according to the guidelines in the owner's manual or installation guide. \\n\\nAlso, check the standpipe for a clog. Use a plumber's snake to remove a clog if water won't drain properly through the standpipe.\\n\\n### Is there too much suds in the washer tub?\\n\\nIt might not be a leak at all. You could have a simple case of “Bobby Brady Syndrome” — adding too much detergent, creating a sudsy mess. Make sure you’re using the proper amount of detergent to prevent excessive suds that can overflow the tub and appear as a leak.\\n\\nIf those things check out and you’ve still got water leaking when the machine isn’t running, turn off the water and call the pros at Sears Home Services to fix your washer.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What to Do If Top-Load Your Washer is Vibrating or Thumping\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X7bkaz_A3q0?rel=0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nWhen your washing machine is making loud vibrating or banging noises, here’s what may silence it:\\n\\n### 1. Did you overload the washer?\\n\\nOverloading can lead to an unbalanced load. Unbalanced loads can cause vibration or thumping. Stop the washer and evenly distribute the load inside the tub — it might be as simple as that.\\n\\nFollow the guidelines in your owner's manual to prevent overloading the washer.\\n\\n### 2. Is the washing machine level?\\n\\nAre all four feet of your washer on the floor? Are the legs properly installed? If they are, see if your dryer is making the same sort of noise. If it is, your floor could very well be the issue. \\n\\nIf your laundry room floor is unstable, try this: Place a piece of ¾-inch plywood underneath both the washer and dryer to create a level surface.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What to Do If Your Top-Load Washer Doesn’t Fill With Water\\n\\nIf your top-load direct-drive washer won’t fill with water, several components could be to blame. For example, the washer could have a malfunctioning water inlet valve or water level pressure switch, or it could be the timer or temperature switches. \\n\\nThis video from Sears PartsDirect shows how to troubleshoot problems with your washer, including checking for continuity with a multimeter to find out which part needs to be replaced so that you can get your washer working again.\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwKnEKa_ic0?rel=0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n## What to Do If Your Washer Leaves Detergent Residue On Your Clothes \\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8Y-ayE7zDo?rel=0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nHaving to rewash clothes is a big hassle — not to mention a water and energy waster. If your washer is leaving traces of detergent behind, ask yourself:\\n\\n### 1. Are you using the detergent dispenser?\\nAlways use it when adding detergent. If your machine doesn’t have one built in, add the measured amount of detergent before adding the laundry load.\\n\\n### 2. How old is that box of detergent?\\nIf you can’t remember the last time you bought detergent, toss the box and get a new one.\\n\\n### 3. Did I overload the washer?\\nWe know how tempting this can be. But detergent can get trapped between tightly packed loads, and if there’s not enough water, the detergent might not dissolve completely.\\n\\n### 4. Is the culprit the cold water, gentle or delicate cycles?\\nIf you’re doing a dark load and the water is very cold, powder detergents may not dissolve. That’s also the case if you’re running gentle or delicate cycles. Use liquid for these loads.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What to Do If Your Top-Load Washer Won’t Start\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JH8ni6Qe5bQ?rel=0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What to Do If Your Washer Stops Mid-Cycle  \\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/McwUpLlY7D8?rel=0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nDon’t panic. It might not be as serious as it looks. Here are some things to try:\\n\\n### 1. Is it, um, plugged in?\\nFour words you never want to hear from a service tech: “It wasn’t plugged in.” Before you do anything else, check to make sure the power cord is still plugged into a grounded outlet. If it is, see if the outlet itself is working by plugging in another electronic device like a hairdryer or a lamp. If that works, the outlet’s functioning. If it doesn’t, check your fuse box or circuit breaker. Still nothing? If the outlet has a reset button, press that bad boy and hope your washer springs to life.\\n\\n### 2. Is the power on?\\nWe hate to even suggest that you didn’t press power — ’cause how embarrassing would that be?\\n\\n### 3. Is there a delay button?\\nSome washers have a delay feature. You may have pressed that button inadvertently. Press stop twice to cancel any delay.\\n\\n### 4. Is the lid closed all the way?\\nAgain, some washers won’t function if the lid isn’t tightly closed.\\n\\n### 5. Are you using an extension cord?\\nIf so, you’re getting less voltage to the washer and it can run hot as a result. If that happens, it’ll shut down mid-cycle. Stop using the extension cord.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you’ve tried these troubleshooting tips and your top-load washer still won’t run properly, it might be time to reach out for professional help. A quick diagnostic can reveal hidden issues like worn-out belts or motor problems.

For a top-load washer, a clogged house drain or a damaged or loose drain hose are the top causes of water leaks.\\\",\\\"faqQuestion3\\\":\\\"Is it safe to use a leaking washing machine?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer3\\\":\\\"No. A leak from the washing machine will cause a wet floor next to the electrical outlet. Shut off the house circuit breaker for the washer when you see a major leak that fills the whole laundry space floor. Unplug the washing machine power cord if you can do so safely by standing on a dry portion of the floor. Fix the leak or have a service technician fix the leak before using the washing machine. Soak up or pick up water that leaked on the floor before plugging the washing machine back in.\\\",\\\"faqQuestion4\\\":\\\"How do I clear the drainage in my washing machine?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer4\\\":\\\"The best way to clear the drainage system in your washing machine is to use a wet/dry shop vacuum to suck a clog out through then end of the washer drain hose. For a front load washer, you may also need to remove the drain pump filter and remove debris from that filter after emptying water from the washer tub.\\\",\\\"image\\\":{\\\"__typename\\\":\\\"Figure\\\",\\\"caption\\\":null,\\\"altText\\\":\\\"Homeowner discovering her washing machine leaking water and calling for washer repair service\\\",\\\"onClickUrl\\\":null,\\\"tooltip\\\":null,\\\"height\\\":null,\\\"width\\\":null,\\\"image\\\":{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/5gc1VULAZ3gI1rJirX6L2t/0625d5791c66817b3eb449c4dbff6206/how-to-fix-a-leaking-washing-machine.png\\\",\\\"height\\\":2617,\\\"width\\\":4050}},\\\"linkedResourcesTotal\\\":37},{\\\"sys\\\":{\\\"id\\\":\\\"4bTEq48Jvuu27ssmzSwJYN\\\",\\\"publishedAt\\\":\\\"2025-12-22T17:57:39.501Z\\\"},\\\"slug\\\":\\\"how-does-a-pressure-switch-work-explanation\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"How Does a Pressure Switch Work?: A Practical Explanation\\\",\\\"shortDescription\\\":\\\"Learn how a pressure switch works in a washing machine to control water fill level.\\\",\\\"creationDateTime\\\":\\\"2024-11-04T06:00:00.000-06:00\\\",\\\"productType\\\":\\\"Washer\\\",\\\"category\\\":\\\"REPAIR\\\",\\\"intro\\\":\\\"Your washing machine is an incredibly convenient appliance, transforming loads of dirty laundry into fresh, clean clothes with just the touch of some buttons.
