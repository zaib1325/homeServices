They’re positioned about 6-inches above the ground to detect foreign objects or obstructions in the path of the closing garage door to prevent injuries or damage to the garage door.\\n\\nThe emitter gets power from the logic board and wires. It sends an infrared beam of light from the emitter to the receiver module. If the receiver module doesn’t detect the infrared beam because the beam is blocked by a person or object while closing the garage door, the opener will reverse the direction of the door and open it back up. The lights will typically blink (often 10 times) when the sensors detect an obstruction between the infrared beams.\\n\\nThe garage door opener will also reverse the door and blink the lights if the emitter and receiver modules are misaligned and the receiver module isn’t detecting the infrared beam from the emitter module.\\n\\n![how-to-align-the-garage-door-opener-safety-sensors](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/3WSCJlOWGLgzR7ZW3JvXrR/4dfe444efc9c4d59f2477479c68fa10c/aligning-a-garage-door-opener-safety-sensor-image.png)\\n\\n## How to Align Garage Door Opener Safety Sensor\\n\\nLights on the emitter and receiver modules help you align the safety sensors so they work properly.\\n\\nThe emitter module typically has a yellow light that should be lit all of the time. The receiver module has a green light that turns on when the receiver detects the emitted infrared beam because the modules are aligned and unblocked by any obstructions.\\n\\nWhen aligning the sensors, make sure the yellow emitter light is on and adjust the positions of the emitter and receiver modules until the green light turns on – indicating that the infrared beam is aligned.\\n\\n## How to Tell When Something’s Wrong\\n\\nThe first key to knowing that something is wrong with the safety sensor is that the garage door won’t close using the opener. When you activate the garage door opener to shut the garage door, the door may begin to close and then reverse and move back to the fully open position. The lights on the garage door opener motor unit will often blink, indicating an obstruction in the safety sensor beam path or that the sensors aren’t aligned.\\n\\nRemove the obstruction or realign the sensor in this situation.\\n\\nIf the door doesn’t move at all, the sensor may not be connected properly through the wires to the motor unit or the sensors may be defective. Wiring between the motor unit and the sensors or a bad logic board on the garage door opener could also be causing this failure.\\n\\n## Troubleshooting Garage Door Sensor Problems\\n\\nTo troubleshoot this garage door opener problem, follow the expert tips in this popular video from Sears PartsDirect that has over 1 million views:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D1-jABFaOLU\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nIf you’re unable to find and fix the garage door opener failure on your own, schedule [garage door opener repair](/repair) service and we’ll send a technician to your home to diagnose the issue and get your garage door opener working again.\\n\\nSometimes, you may encounter an intermittent problem with the garage door opener sensors – especially on clear winter days when sunlight reflects off snow and ice to interfere with the infrared sensing beams. When you suspect this type of problem is preventing the garage door from closing properly, install garage door opener sun shields as shown in this helpful video:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iFJd5n6MEX0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n## Maintaining Your Garage Door and Opener\\n\\nKeeping your garage door and its opener well-maintained are key to their smooth operation. Problems with the door can jostle the safety sensors out of alignment or cause wiring problems. Checking the garage door opener regularly will ensure its safe operation.\\n\\n### Garage Door Maintenance\\n\\nHere's a handy garage door maintenance checklist:\\n\\n* __Inspect and clean the garage door tracks:__ Begin by visually inspecting the tracks for signs of wear or damage. Clean any dirt or debris to ensure smooth operation and prevent the door from jamming.\\n* __Lubricate moving parts:__ Use a silicone-based lubricant to reduce friction and ensure smooth operation of hinges, rollers, and springs. Wipe off any excess lubricant to prevent accumulation of dirt and debris.\\n* __Check garage door springs:__ Garage door springs play a crucial role in balancing the door weight. Inspect them for signs of damage like rust or fraying. If you find any issues, it's best to seek professional help for spring adjustments or replacements.\\n* __Inspect the garage door lock:__ Test the garage door lock operation. Lubricate parts if necessary. Replace any worn or broken parts. You’ll rarely use the garage door lock when you have a garage door opener installed, but you want to be sure it works if and when you do need it.\\n\\n### Garage Door Opener Maintenance\\n\\nHere are essential tips to help keep your garage door opener well-maintained and working safely:\\n\\n* __Test the safety sensors:__ Ensure that safety features like sensors and the auto-reverse function are working correctly. You can test the safety sensors by placing an object in the door's path and ensuring the door reverses and goes back up when you activate the garage door opener to close the door. If these features are malfunctioning, troubleshoot the problem as discussed above or contact a [garage door opener repair](/repair) professional.\\n* __Check the auto-reverse function:__ To test the auto-reverse safety function of your garage door opener, you can: \\n     * Make sure the garage door is fully open.\\n     * Place a 1.5 inch thick board or a 2x4 on the floor in the center of the garage door .\\n     * Press the remote or wall button to close the door.\\n     * The door should stop and reverse when it hits the board. If not, adjust the downforce setting as described below or have the garage door opener repaired or replaced by a professional.\\n* __Check the garage door opener downforce setting:__ Some garage door openers use small dials on the motor unit to control the downforce when closing the garage door. Make sure that the downforce is not set too high. Excessive downforce is dangerous and can cause property damage or injury to anything caught in the path of door. Close the door with the opener and carefully grab it with your hand when the door is halfway down to make sure that the downforce isn't excessive. If you can stop the door using your hand, then no further adjustment is necessary. If you’re unable to stop the door with your hand, reduce the downforce in small increments. Make adjustments until the door closes completely on its own but will still stop if you catch it halfway down. Here’s a YouTube video that illustrates how to adjust force settings on common garage door openers:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WI-vVCS-0jo\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nIf your garage door opener has a battery backup, test the battery. To test the battery, unplug the garage door opener; the battery status LED light should glow solid orange, indicating the opener is running on battery power. If the LED light flashes, that means it’s time to replace the battery because the battery power is low.\\n\\nMaintenance and safety checks for your model of garage door opener may differ from the procedures described above. Check your owner’s manual for information about maintenance specific to your garage door opener.\\n\\nRegular [garage door maintenance](https://www.searsgaragedoors.com/repairs) not only extends your garage door's lifespan and keeps it operating safely, but also helps avoid unexpected breakdowns.\\n\"])",

If it is, the water and ice dispenser  won’t work.\\n\\nTurn the child lock feature off if you find it enabled. For most fridges, you’ll need to press and hold the dispenser button marked with the lock icon label for 5 seconds.\\n\\nAfter turning off the child lock, the water dispenser (and ice dispenser) should work again.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![check-for-frozen-water-reservoir](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/7KhNA6qVX7vP2RgIoCBxEz/db674e7c187f3419243d902b5c63d7b6/refrigerator-water-dispenser-reservoir.png)\\n\\n## Check for a Frozen Water Supply Line or Frozen Water Reservoir\\n\\nIn the back of some refrigerator compartments, behind the crisper drawers, you’ll find a water reservoir or coiled up section of water tubing that cools down water for the water dispenser.\\n\\nA frozen line or frozen reservoir can prevent the water dispenser from getting water. Check for a frozen water line or reservoir and thaw the freeze using a hair dryer on a low heat setting.\\n\\nThis tactic may fix the water dispenser.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Check the Water Supply\\n\\nCheck to see if the ice maker is getting water. Empty the ice bin into a container and store that ice in the freezer. Once the ice maker cycles a dumps a batch of ice, see if the ice mold is filled with water to make a new batch of ice or see if the ice maker dumps a second batch of ice.\\n\\nIf the ice maker is getting water and making ice, then you know that the water supply going to the refrigerator is okay.\\n\\nIf the ice maker isn’t getting water, replace the water filter if you haven’t replaced it within the last 6 months. This may restore the water supply.\\n\\nIf the water filter isn’t the problem, check the water supply going to the fridge using this procedure:\\n\\n1. Shut off the water supply cut-off valve for the refrigerator.\\n2. Disconnect the water supply line from the back of the refrigerator.\\n3. Place the end of the water supply line in a bucket and briefly open the water supply cut-off valve.\\n\\nIf water doesn’t flow from the end of the water line, have a plumber fix the water supply going to the refrigerator.\\n\\nIf water flows from the end of the water supply line, then you know that the house water supply for the refrigerator is okay.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![check-the-refrigerator-water-valve](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/28QaHepQAqYgtpv9aLunf6/8934882ce37114d2e18b66d4b12ae4b4/replacing-the-refrigerator-inlet-water-valve.png)\\n\\n## Examine the Inlet Water Valve\\n\\nIf the water supply going to the refrigerator is okay, then __unplug the fridge__ and check the wire harness connection on the inlet water valve.\\n\\nReconnect the inlet water valve wires if you find them loose or disconnected.\\n\\nIf the wire harness connection is okay, then a bad water inlet valve could be preventing the water dispenser and ice maker from getting water. Other failures such as a damaged internal wire or bad control component could keep the water inlet valve from working. \\n\\nSchedule [refrigerator repair](/repair/refrigerator-repair-service) service to have a technician check the water valve circuit. The tech will need to conduct a live voltage check to see if the valve is getting voltage when you press the dispenser lever. If the valve is getting voltage but not opening to supply water to the water dispenser and ice maker, then the technician will replace the water inlet valve.\\n\\nIf you suspect that the water valve is defective and you want to replace it yourself without further diagnosis, follow the steps in this video to install a new water inlet valve:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tU4UK2ELxOM\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nReplacing the inlet water valve without a full diagnosis of the problem is a risk but it may fix the water dispenser failure.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![disassembled-water-dispenser](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/I1NwsyW8DCZeU6v1k93vO/38da94c94c6128014b0d7cd5a25714b8/disassembled-refrigerator-dispenser.png)\\n\\n## Water Dispenser Control Problems\\n\\nA failed micro-switch or bad dispenser control board can prevent the water dispenser working.\\n\\nWhen the troubleshooting steps outlined above don’t help you fix a water dispenser failure, schedule [refrigerator repair](/repair/refrigerator-repair-service) service to inspect the dispenser components and find the cause of the failure.\\n\\n## How to know if your refrigerator water valve is bad\\n\\nA service technician will check to see if the valve is getting electrical current when actuated. If the valve coil is getting current but doesn’t open, the technician will replace the water valve. This type of live voltage check isn’t safe for DIY’ers. To check the water inlet valve on your own, unplug the refrigerator and check the resistance through the water valve solenoid coil using a multimeter. The meter should typically measure 200 to 500 ohms of resistance if it’s good. If the meter measures infinite resistance, replace the water valve because it is bad.\\n\\n### Cost to replace a water inlet valve on a refrigerator\\n\\nIf you can replace the water inlet valve yourself, then all that you’ll spend is the price of the replacement part – typically between $20 and $100. If you need to have a service technician replace the valve, that repair will typically cost you between $150 and $300.\\n\\n### Life expectancy of a water valve\\n\\nRefrigerator water valves typically last 15 to 20 years but a failure in this type of device can occur at any time.\\n\\n---\\n\\nKnowing about the different types of failures that can prevent your refrigerator water dispenser from working will help you determine the right corrective action to take.\\n\\nAlthough you can fix some fridge water dispenser issues on your own, more complicated failures will require a visit from a technician.\\n\\nWhen you need a technician to fix your refrigerator water dispenser, trust [Sears Home Services](/repair) to get the job done.

It’s frustrating when you press the lever, only to find no water flowing. \\\\n\\\\nBefore calling a repair technician, you can sometimes troubleshoot and resolve the issue yourself.\\\\n\\\\nHere's a detailed guide to fixing a refrigerator water dispenser that isn’t working.\\\\n\\\",\\\"keyTakeaway1\\\":\\\"Check and disable the dispenser's child lock feature, which can prevent the water and ice dispenser from working. This is a quick and easy solution that resolves many issues.\\\",\\\"keyTakeaway2\\\":\\\"Investigate potential issues like a frozen water line or reservoir, a clogged water filter, or an interrupted water supply. Thaw frozen components and replace the water filter if it hasn't been changed in the last six months.\\\",\\\"keyTakeaway3\\\":\\\"If basic troubleshooting doesn’t work, inspect more complex parts such as the water inlet valve and the dispenser control board. If these components fail, professional diagnosis or replacement might be required.\\\",\\\"information\\\":\\\"$20\\\",\\\"secondaryClassification\\\":null,\\\"faqQuestion1\\\":\\\"Why does my refrigerator water dispenser stop working even though the fridge is cooling properly?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer1\\\":\\\"A refrigerator can cool normally while the water dispenser fails because the two systems operate independently. Common causes include the dispenser child lock being turned on, a frozen water reservoir or supply line, a clogged water filter, or a faulty inlet water valve. Cooling issues affect the compressor, while dispenser problems are usually related to water flow or electrical controls.\\\",\\\"faqQuestion2\\\":\\\"How can I tell if the problem is my refrigerator or my home’s water supply?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer2\\\":\\\"An easy way to confirm this is by checking whether the ice maker is producing ice. If the ice maker is working, the refrigerator is receiving water from the home supply. If not, disconnect the water line from the back of the refrigerator and briefly open the shut-off valve into a bucket. No water flow indicates a household plumbing issue, while good flow points to a refrigerator component problem.\\\",\\\"faqQuestion3\\\":\\\"Can a frozen water line really stop the dispenser from working?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer3\\\":\\\"Yes. Many refrigerators use a water reservoir or coiled tubing inside the fresh food compartment to chill drinking water. If the refrigerator temperature is set too low or airflow is restricted, this tubing can freeze and block water flow. Gently thawing the line with a hair dryer on low heat often restores normal operation.\\\",\\\"faqQuestion4\\\":\\\"When should I call a professional instead of attempting a DIY repair?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer4\\\":\\\"If basic troubleshooting steps don’t restore water flow—or if the issue involves electrical testing, live voltage checks, or control boards—it’s best to call a professional. Components like inlet water valves and dispenser control boards require specialized tools and safety procedures. A Sears Home Services technician can accurately diagnose the problem and complete the repair safely and efficiently.\\\",\\\"image\\\":{\\\"__typename\\\":\\\"Figure\\\",\\\"caption\\\":null,\\\"altText\\\":\\\"Homeowner discovering the refrigerator water dispenser not working\\\",\\\"onClickUrl\\\":null,\\\"tooltip\\\":null,\\\"height\\\":null,\\\"width\\\":null,\\\"image\\\":{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/wG9WnOn121b2dfKZIROwE/7b51e7f398afa7043e543fb582f5b0b2/refrigerator-dispenser-not-working.png\\\",\\\"height\\\":475,\\\"width\\\":851}},\\\"linkedResourcesTotal\\\":49},{\\\"sys\\\":{\\\"id\\\":\\\"6bVwKpGGyZffEGr477zyxz\\\",\\\"publishedAt\\\":\\\"2026-01-05T12:40:41.075Z\\\"},\\\"slug\\\":\\\"breaking-down-the-cost-to-replace-a-dishwasher-update\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"Breaking Down the Cost to Replace a Dishwasher\\\",\\\"shortDescription\\\":\\\"Learn about the costs of replacing your dishwasher and get expert advice on dishwasher replacement from Sears Home Services. \\\",\\\"creationDateTime\\\":\\\"2024-05-09T07:00:00.000-05:00\\\",\\\"category\\\":\\\"REPAIR\\\",\\\"productType\\\":\\\"Dishwasher\\\",\\\"intro\\\":\\\"When you're wondering, \\\\\\\"how much does it cost to replace a dishwasher?\\\\\\\", you're in the right place.
