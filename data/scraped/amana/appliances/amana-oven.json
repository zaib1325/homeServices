A service call involves diagnosing the appliance's malfunction and making repairs quickly. A repair technician can also recommend routine maintenance to extend your oven's life.\nWe work on Amana ovens all the time. While mostly a reliable appliance, your oven can eventually break at any time.\nAfter thousands of service visits, we've identified several issues that tend to frustrate homeowners most.\nOven Not Heating Up\nTurn the oven on and wait. And wait. And nothing happens. No heat. This happens with Amanas more than you'd think. It’s usually caused by a few common culprits.\n\nThe igniter gets weak over time. It's supposed to glow hot enough to open the gas valve, but after a few years they just can't get hot enough anymore. You might see it glowing orange but the burner never lights. Or sometimes it takes forever to light, way longer than it should. Igniters aren't cheap parts, but they're the most common thing to fail on gas Amana ovens.\nElectric models have different problems. The bake element might be burned out. Look for holes or blisters in the element, or spots where it's clearly broken. They don't always show obvious damage though. Sometimes they look fine but are dead inside. Like some people I've worked with over the years.\nBroken wires happen too. The oven gets hot, then cold, over and over for years. Wires get brittle. Connections work loose. One bad connection anywhere in the circuit and the whole oven won't heat.\n\nControl Board Problems\nControl boards go bad in the newer electronic models. Everything looks normal on the display, but no command ever reaches the heating elements. These boards hate power surges. One good lightning storm and they're fried. Replacing them isn't a simple job. They cost a fair bit too, sometimes almost half what a new oven would run you.\nSchedule wall oven repair when the control won’t work on your Amana oven.\nTemperature All Wrong\nWe had a customer last month, said his cookies always burned even when he set the temperature real low. It turns out his Amana oven was running about 75 degrees hotter than what the control was set to. Temperature issues are frustrating.\nThe temperature sensor goes out of calibration. It's just a little probe sticking into the back of the oven cavity. It gets covered in grease and gunk over time. Sometimes it gets bent or damaged when people clean. If it's not in the right position or damaged, you get bad readings.\nLoose connections to the sensor cause temperature swings too. The computer thinks the oven is colder than it really is because it's getting intermittent readings. So it overshoots the temp you wanted.\nThe thermostat in older models gets sticky. Mechanical parts wear out. They don't cycle on and off like they should. Your oven just keeps getting hotter and hotter. That’s not good for that delicate pastry recipe.\nSchedule appliance repair service whenever you run into heating problems with your Amana oven.\nThe Door Won't Close Right\nOven doors take abuse over their life. Slammed shut. Kids hanging on them. Heavy roasting pans bumping into them. Eventually they get out of whack.\nHinges wear out or bend. The door doesn't sit flush anymore. Heat escapes around the edges. Your kitchen gets hot while your food doesn't. Sometimes you can adjust the hinges a bit, but usually they need replacement when they get bad.\nDoor springs weaken too. The door might drop suddenly instead of closing gently. Those springs help support the weight of the door. When they get weak, the hinges take more stress than they were designed for. Leads to more problems down the road.\nThe gasket around the door gets torn or compressed. Doesn't make a good seal anymore. Heat leaks out. Makes the oven work harder and your food take longer to cook. Gaskets can be replaced, but getting the old adhesive off is a pain in the neck.\nSelf-Cleaning Problems\nSelf-cleaning sounds great on paper. In practice, it's where a lot of problems start. Amanas are no exception.\n\nThe extreme heat during cleaning kills electronic parts. Control boards, switches, and wiring take a beating when the oven gets that hot. Sometimes they work fine for years, then you run self-clean once and something dies. That’s just the way it goes.\nDoor locks stick after cleaning. The lock is supposed to release when the oven cools down. Sometimes the mechanism gets gummed up or bent and the door stays locked. Not ideal when your oven is suddenly a vault you can't open.\nHeating elements give up during the clean cycle. All that extra heat pushes them past their breaking point, especially if they were already getting weak. Many repair guys will tell you to never use self-clean. Just wipe the oven out regular instead.\n\nBurners Acting Up\nCooktop burners have their own sets of problems, different ones for gas and electric models.\nGas burners clog up with food spills. The little holes get blocked and you see uneven flames or yellow tips instead of blue. Poking them clean with a pin helps sometimes, but you’ve got to be careful not to enlarge the holes.\nSpark igniters fail or get dirty. You hear them clicking but the burner won't light. Or they don't click at all. Food boils over and gums up the igniter. Clean them with a toothbrush and some alcohol. Beats replacing them.\nElectric coils have it rough. Stuff spills on them constantly. They're built to take it, but connections corrode over time. The burner receptacles where they plug in get burned or bent. Sometimes a burner works when you jiggle it just right, but that's a fire hazard waiting to happen.\nStrange Noises\nAmana ovens make all kinds of weird sounds when they're having trouble. Different noises mean different problems.\nBuzzing or humming usually points to something electrical. Relay switches buzz when they're not making good contact. The transformer hums louder than it should when it's going bad. Bad news either way.\nClicking repeatedly, not just when starting up, means a relay or switch is cycling on and off too fast. It could be a bad connection or failing part.\nGrinding noises from the convection fan mean the bearings are shot. Or something's come loose and is hitting the fan blade. Shut it off until it's fixed or you'll have a bigger problem.\nBooming when a gas oven ignites means gas built up before lighting. The igniter's weak or the gas flow needs adjustment. Not something to ignore - it can get dangerous.\nDigital Display Dead\nThe display screen just dies on some models. It goes completely blank or shows gibberish.\n\nPower glitches kill these displays sometimes. Try resetting the control board. Unplug the oven shut off the house circuit breaker for a few minutes. Restore power and see if the oven works. This simple fix sometimes works.\nRibbon cables work loose. They connect the display to the control board. Heat and time make them brittle or they just vibrate loose. Getting to them means taking apart the control panel. Not difficult but lots of small screws to keep track of.\nWater damage happens too. Steam from cooking gets into places it shouldn't. Condensation builds up inside the control panel. Eventually shorts something out. Doesn't help that many kitchens put the oven below the cooktop where all the steam rises past the controls.\n\nWhen To Call For Service\nSome Amana oven issues you can handle yourself. Cleaning burners, replacing light bulbs, maybe even changing the oven gasket if you're handy. Keep your manual handy. Save yourself a service call when it's something simple.\nBut for anything involving gas, electricity, or major disassembly, that's when calling us makes sense. Our techs have seen every Amana problem there is. Keeping your family safe matters more than saving a few bucks trying to fix a gas valve yourself.\nWe stock parts for all the common Amana problems.

The computer thinks the oven is colder than it really is because it's getting intermittent readings. So it overshoots the temp you wanted.\nThe thermostat in older models gets sticky. Mechanical parts wear out. They don't cycle on and off like they should. Your oven just keeps getting hotter and hotter. That’s not good for that delicate pastry recipe.\nSchedule appliance repair service whenever you run into heating problems with your Amana oven.\nThe Door Won't Close Right\nOven doors take abuse over their life. Slammed shut. Kids hanging on them. Heavy roasting pans bumping into them. Eventually they get out of whack.\nHinges wear out or bend. The door doesn't sit flush anymore. Heat escapes around the edges. Your kitchen gets hot while your food doesn't. Sometimes you can adjust the hinges a bit, but usually they need replacement when they get bad.\nDoor springs weaken too. The door might drop suddenly instead of closing gently. Those springs help support the weight of the door. When they get weak, the hinges take more stress than they were designed for. Leads to more problems down the road.\nThe gasket around the door gets torn or compressed. Doesn't make a good seal anymore. Heat leaks out. Makes the oven work harder and your food take longer to cook. Gaskets can be replaced, but getting the old adhesive off is a pain in the neck.\nSelf-Cleaning Problems\nSelf-cleaning sounds great on paper. In practice, it's where a lot of problems start. Amanas are no exception.\n\nThe extreme heat during cleaning kills electronic parts. Control boards, switches, and wiring take a beating when the oven gets that hot. Sometimes they work fine for years, then you run self-clean once and something dies. That’s just the way it goes.\nDoor locks stick after cleaning. The lock is supposed to release when the oven cools down. Sometimes the mechanism gets gummed up or bent and the door stays locked. Not ideal when your oven is suddenly a vault you can't open.\nHeating elements give up during the clean cycle. All that extra heat pushes them past their breaking point, especially if they were already getting weak. Many repair guys will tell you to never use self-clean. Just wipe the oven out regular instead.\n\nBurners Acting Up\nCooktop burners have their own sets of problems, different ones for gas and electric models.\nGas burners clog up with food spills. The little holes get blocked and you see uneven flames or yellow tips instead of blue. Poking them clean with a pin helps sometimes, but you’ve got to be careful not to enlarge the holes.\nSpark igniters fail or get dirty. You hear them clicking but the burner won't light. Or they don't click at all. Food boils over and gums up the igniter. Clean them with a toothbrush and some alcohol. Beats replacing them.\nElectric coils have it rough. Stuff spills on them constantly. They're built to take it, but connections corrode over time. The burner receptacles where they plug in get burned or bent. Sometimes a burner works when you jiggle it just right, but that's a fire hazard waiting to happen.\nStrange Noises\nAmana ovens make all kinds of weird sounds when they're having trouble. Different noises mean different problems.\nBuzzing or humming usually points to something electrical. Relay switches buzz when they're not making good contact. The transformer hums louder than it should when it's going bad. Bad news either way.\nClicking repeatedly, not just when starting up, means a relay or switch is cycling on and off too fast. It could be a bad connection or failing part.\nGrinding noises from the convection fan mean the bearings are shot. Or something's come loose and is hitting the fan blade. Shut it off until it's fixed or you'll have a bigger problem.\nBooming when a gas oven ignites means gas built up before lighting. The igniter's weak or the gas flow needs adjustment. Not something to ignore - it can get dangerous.\nDigital Display Dead\nThe display screen just dies on some models. It goes completely blank or shows gibberish.\n\nPower glitches kill these displays sometimes. Try resetting the control board. Unplug the oven shut off the house circuit breaker for a few minutes. Restore power and see if the oven works. This simple fix sometimes works.\nRibbon cables work loose. They connect the display to the control board. Heat and time make them brittle or they just vibrate loose. Getting to them means taking apart the control panel. Not difficult but lots of small screws to keep track of.\nWater damage happens too. Steam from cooking gets into places it shouldn't. Condensation builds up inside the control panel. Eventually shorts something out. Doesn't help that many kitchens put the oven below the cooktop where all the steam rises past the controls.\n\nWhen To Call For Service\nSome Amana oven issues you can handle yourself. Cleaning burners, replacing light bulbs, maybe even changing the oven gasket if you're handy. Keep your manual handy. Save yourself a service call when it's something simple.\nBut for anything involving gas, electricity, or major disassembly, that's when calling us makes sense. Our techs have seen every Amana problem there is. Keeping your family safe matters more than saving a few bucks trying to fix a gas valve yourself.\nWe stock parts for all the common Amana problems. Can usually fix things in one visit. And we guarantee our work. No crossing your fingers hoping you fixed it right.\nGive us a call when your Amana needs professional attention.

A service call involves diagnosing the appliance's malfunction and making repairs quickly. A repair technician can also recommend routine maintenance to extend your oven's life.\nWe work on Amana ovens all the time. While mostly a reliable appliance, your oven can eventually break at any time.\nAfter thousands of service visits, we've identified several issues that tend to frustrate homeowners most.\nOven Not Heating Up\nTurn the oven on and wait. And wait. And nothing happens. No heat. This happens with Amanas more than you'd think. It’s usually caused by a few common culprits.\n\nThe igniter gets weak over time. It's supposed to glow hot enough to open the gas valve, but after a few years they just can't get hot enough anymore. You might see it glowing orange but the burner never lights. Or sometimes it takes forever to light, way longer than it should. Igniters aren't cheap parts, but they're the most common thing to fail on gas Amana ovens.\nElectric models have different problems. The bake element might be burned out. Look for holes or blisters in the element, or spots where it's clearly broken. They don't always show obvious damage though. Sometimes they look fine but are dead inside. Like some people I've worked with over the years.\nBroken wires happen too. The oven gets hot, then cold, over and over for years. Wires get brittle. Connections work loose. One bad connection anywhere in the circuit and the whole oven won't heat.\n\nControl Board Problems\nControl boards go bad in the newer electronic models. Everything looks normal on the display, but no command ever reaches the heating elements. These boards hate power surges. One good lightning storm and they're fried. Replacing them isn't a simple job. They cost a fair bit too, sometimes almost half what a new oven would run you.\nSchedule wall oven repair when the control won’t work on your Amana oven.\nTemperature All Wrong\nWe had a customer last month, said his cookies always burned even when he set the temperature real low. It turns out his Amana oven was running about 75 degrees hotter than what the control was set to. Temperature issues are frustrating.\nThe temperature sensor goes out of calibration. It's just a little probe sticking into the back of the oven cavity. It gets covered in grease and gunk over time. Sometimes it gets bent or damaged when people clean. If it's not in the right position or damaged, you get bad readings.\nLoose connections to the sensor cause temperature swings too. The computer thinks the oven is colder than it really is because it's getting intermittent readings. So it overshoots the temp you wanted.\nThe thermostat in older models gets sticky. Mechanical parts wear out. They don't cycle on and off like they should. Your oven just keeps getting hotter and hotter. That’s not good for that delicate pastry recipe.\nSchedule appliance repair service whenever you run into heating problems with your Amana oven.\nThe Door Won't Close Right\nOven doors take abuse over their life. Slammed shut. Kids hanging on them. Heavy roasting pans bumping into them. Eventually they get out of whack.\nHinges wear out or bend. The door doesn't sit flush anymore. Heat escapes around the edges. Your kitchen gets hot while your food doesn't. Sometimes you can adjust the hinges a bit, but usually they need replacement when they get bad.\nDoor springs weaken too. The door might drop suddenly instead of closing gently. Those springs help support the weight of the door. When they get weak, the hinges take more stress than they were designed for. Leads to more problems down the road.\nThe gasket around the door gets torn or compressed. Doesn't make a good seal anymore. Heat leaks out. Makes the oven work harder and your food take longer to cook. Gaskets can be replaced, but getting the old adhesive off is a pain in the neck.\nSelf-Cleaning Problems\nSelf-cleaning sounds great on paper. In practice, it's where a lot of problems start. Amanas are no exception.\n\nThe extreme heat during cleaning kills electronic parts. Control boards, switches, and wiring take a beating when the oven gets that hot. Sometimes they work fine for years, then you run self-clean once and something dies. That’s just the way it goes.\nDoor locks stick after cleaning. The lock is supposed to release when the oven cools down. Sometimes the mechanism gets gummed up or bent and the door stays locked. Not ideal when your oven is suddenly a vault you can't open.\nHeating elements give up during the clean cycle. All that extra heat pushes them past their breaking point, especially if they were already getting weak. Many repair guys will tell you to never use self-clean. Just wipe the oven out regular instead.\n\nBurners Acting Up\nCooktop burners have their own sets of problems, different ones for gas and electric models.\nGas burners clog up with food spills. The little holes get blocked and you see uneven flames or yellow tips instead of blue. Poking them clean with a pin helps sometimes, but you’ve got to be careful not to enlarge the holes.\nSpark igniters fail or get dirty. You hear them clicking but the burner won't light. Or they don't click at all. Food boils over and gums up the igniter. Clean them with a toothbrush and some alcohol. Beats replacing them.\nElectric coils have it rough. Stuff spills on them constantly. They're built to take it, but connections corrode over time. The burner receptacles where they plug in get burned or bent. Sometimes a burner works when you jiggle it just right, but that's a fire hazard waiting to happen.\nStrange Noises\nAmana ovens make all kinds of weird sounds when they're having trouble. Different noises mean different problems.\nBuzzing or humming usually points to something electrical. Relay switches buzz when they're not making good contact. The transformer hums louder than it should when it's going bad. Bad news either way.\nClicking repeatedly, not just when starting up, means a relay or switch is cycling on and off too fast. It could be a bad connection or failing part.\nGrinding noises from the convection fan mean the bearings are shot. Or something's come loose and is hitting the fan blade. Shut it off until it's fixed or you'll have a bigger problem.\nBooming when a gas oven ignites means gas built up before lighting. The igniter's weak or the gas flow needs adjustment. Not something to ignore - it can get dangerous.\nDigital Display Dead\nThe display screen just dies on some models. It goes completely blank or shows gibberish.\n\nPower glitches kill these displays sometimes. Try resetting the control board. Unplug the oven shut off the house circuit breaker for a few minutes. Restore power and see if the oven works. This simple fix sometimes works.\nRibbon cables work loose. They connect the display to the control board. Heat and time make them brittle or they just vibrate loose. Getting to them means taking apart the control panel. Not difficult but lots of small screws to keep track of.\nWater damage happens too. Steam from cooking gets into places it shouldn't. Condensation builds up inside the control panel. Eventually shorts something out. Doesn't help that many kitchens put the oven below the cooktop where all the steam rises past the controls.\n\nWhen To Call For Service\nSome Amana oven issues you can handle yourself.

        "content": "Amana Oven Repair GuideRegardless of the type of Amana oven you have, the appliance repair experts at Sears Home Services can perform quality repairs for problems big or small. A service call involves diagnosing the appliance's malfunction and making repairs quickly. A repair technician can also recommend routine maintenance to extend your oven's life.\nWe work on Amana ovens all the time. While mostly a reliable appliance, your oven can eventually break at any time.\nAfter thousands of service visits, we've identified several issues that tend to frustrate homeowners most.\nOven Not Heating Up\nTurn the oven on and wait. And wait. And nothing happens. No heat. This happens with Amanas more than you'd think. It’s usually caused by a few common culprits.\n\nThe igniter gets weak over time. It's supposed to glow hot enough to open the gas valve, but after a few years they just can't get hot enough anymore. You might see it glowing orange but the burner never lights. Or sometimes it takes forever to light, way longer than it should. Igniters aren't cheap parts, but they're the most common thing to fail on gas Amana ovens.\nElectric models have different problems. The bake element might be burned out. Look for holes or blisters in the element, or spots where it's clearly broken. They don't always show obvious damage though. Sometimes they look fine but are dead inside. Like some people I've worked with over the years.\nBroken wires happen too. The oven gets hot, then cold, over and over for years. Wires get brittle. Connections work loose. One bad connection anywhere in the circuit and the whole oven won't heat.\n\nControl Board Problems\nControl boards go bad in the newer electronic models. Everything looks normal on the display, but no command ever reaches the heating elements. These boards hate power surges. One good lightning storm and they're fried. Replacing them isn't a simple job. They cost a fair bit too, sometimes almost half what a new oven would run you.\nSchedule wall oven repair when the control won’t work on your Amana oven.\nTemperature All Wrong\nWe had a customer last month, said his cookies always burned even when he set the temperature real low. It turns out his Amana oven was running about 75 degrees hotter than what the control was set to. Temperature issues are frustrating.\nThe temperature sensor goes out of calibration. It's just a little probe sticking into the back of the oven cavity. It gets covered in grease and gunk over time. Sometimes it gets bent or damaged when people clean. If it's not in the right position or damaged, you get bad readings.\nLoose connections to the sensor cause temperature swings too. The computer thinks the oven is colder than it really is because it's getting intermittent readings. So it overshoots the temp you wanted.\nThe thermostat in older models gets sticky. Mechanical parts wear out. They don't cycle on and off like they should. Your oven just keeps getting hotter and hotter. That’s not good for that delicate pastry recipe.\nSchedule appliance repair service whenever you run into heating problems with your Amana oven.\nThe Door Won't Close Right\nOven doors take abuse over their life. Slammed shut. Kids hanging on them. Heavy roasting pans bumping into them. Eventually they get out of whack.\nHinges wear out or bend. The door doesn't sit flush anymore. Heat escapes around the edges. Your kitchen gets hot while your food doesn't. Sometimes you can adjust the hinges a bit, but usually they need replacement when they get bad.\nDoor springs weaken too. The door might drop suddenly instead of closing gently. Those springs help support the weight of the door. When they get weak, the hinges take more stress than they were designed for. Leads to more problems down the road.\nThe gasket around the door gets torn or compressed. Doesn't make a good seal anymore. Heat leaks out. Makes the oven work harder and your food take longer to cook. Gaskets can be replaced, but getting the old adhesive off is a pain in the neck.\nSelf-Cleaning Problems\nSelf-cleaning sounds great on paper. In practice, it's where a lot of problems start. Amanas are no exception.\n\nThe extreme heat during cleaning kills electronic parts. Control boards, switches, and wiring take a beating when the oven gets that hot. Sometimes they work fine for years, then you run self-clean once and something dies. That’s just the way it goes.\nDoor locks stick after cleaning. The lock is supposed to release when the oven cools down. Sometimes the mechanism gets gummed up or bent and the door stays locked. Not ideal when your oven is suddenly a vault you can't open.\nHeating elements give up during the clean cycle. All that extra heat pushes them past their breaking point, especially if they were already getting weak. Many repair guys will tell you to never use self-clean. Just wipe the oven out regular instead.\n\nBurners Acting Up\nCooktop burners have their own sets of problems, different ones for gas and electric models.\nGas burners clog up with food spills. The little holes get blocked and you see uneven flames or yellow tips instead of blue. Poking them clean with a pin helps sometimes, but you’ve got to be careful not to enlarge the holes.\nSpark igniters fail or get dirty. You hear them clicking but the burner won't light. Or they don't click at all. Food boils over and gums up the igniter. Clean them with a toothbrush and some alcohol. Beats replacing them.\nElectric coils have it rough. Stuff spills on them constantly. They're built to take it, but connections corrode over time. The burner receptacles where they plug in get burned or bent. Sometimes a burner works when you jiggle it just right, but that's a fire hazard waiting to happen.\nStrange Noises\nAmana ovens make all kinds of weird sounds when they're having trouble. Different noises mean different problems.\nBuzzing or humming usually points to something electrical. Relay switches buzz when they're not making good contact. The transformer hums louder than it should when it's going bad. Bad news either way.\nClicking repeatedly, not just when starting up, means a relay or switch is cycling on and off too fast. It could be a bad connection or failing part.\nGrinding noises from the convection fan mean the bearings are shot. Or something's come loose and is hitting the fan blade. Shut it off until it's fixed or you'll have a bigger problem.\nBooming when a gas oven ignites means gas built up before lighting. The igniter's weak or the gas flow needs adjustment. Not something to ignore - it can get dangerous.\nDigital Display Dead\nThe display screen just dies on some models. It goes completely blank or shows gibberish.\n\nPower glitches kill these displays sometimes. Try resetting the control board. Unplug the oven shut off the house circuit breaker for a few minutes. Restore power and see if the oven works. This simple fix sometimes works.\nRibbon cables work loose. They connect the display to the control board. Heat and time make them brittle or they just vibrate loose. Getting to them means taking apart the control panel. Not difficult but lots of small screws to keep track of.\nWater damage happens too. Steam from cooking gets into places it shouldn't. Condensation builds up inside the control panel. Eventually shorts something out. Doesn't help that many kitchens put the oven below the cooktop where all the steam rises past the controls.\n\nWhen To Call For Service\nSome Amana oven issues you can handle yourself. Cleaning burners, replacing light bulbs, maybe even changing the oven gasket if you're handy. Keep your manual handy. Save yourself a service call when it's something simple.\nBut for anything involving gas, electricity, or major disassembly, that's when calling us makes sense. Our techs have seen every Amana problem there is. Keeping your family safe matters more than saving a few bucks trying to fix a gas valve yourself.\nWe stock parts for all the common Amana problems. Can usually fix things in one visit. And we guarantee our work. No crossing your fingers hoping you fixed it right.\nGive us a call when your Amana needs professional attention. We'll get your kitchen back to normal without the headache. No more takeout needed.",

        "content": "Amana Oven Repair GuideRegardless of the type of Amana oven you have, the appliance repair experts at Sears Home Services can perform quality repairs for problems big or small. A service call involves diagnosing the appliance's malfunction and making repairs quickly. A repair technician can also recommend routine maintenance to extend your oven's life.\nWe work on Amana ovens all the time. While mostly a reliable appliance, your oven can eventually break at any time.\nAfter thousands of service visits, we've identified several issues that tend to frustrate homeowners most.\nOven Not Heating Up\nTurn the oven on and wait. And wait. And nothing happens. No heat. This happens with Amanas more than you'd think. It’s usually caused by a few common culprits.\n\nThe igniter gets weak over time. It's supposed to glow hot enough to open the gas valve, but after a few years they just can't get hot enough anymore. You might see it glowing orange but the burner never lights. Or sometimes it takes forever to light, way longer than it should. Igniters aren't cheap parts, but they're the most common thing to fail on gas Amana ovens.\nElectric models have different problems. The bake element might be burned out. Look for holes or blisters in the element, or spots where it's clearly broken. They don't always show obvious damage though. Sometimes they look fine but are dead inside. Like some people I've worked with over the years.\nBroken wires happen too. The oven gets hot, then cold, over and over for years. Wires get brittle. Connections work loose. One bad connection anywhere in the circuit and the whole oven won't heat.\n\nControl Board Problems\nControl boards go bad in the newer electronic models. Everything looks normal on the display, but no command ever reaches the heating elements. These boards hate power surges. One good lightning storm and they're fried. Replacing them isn't a simple job. They cost a fair bit too, sometimes almost half what a new oven would run you.\nSchedule wall oven repair when the control won’t work on your Amana oven.\nTemperature All Wrong\nWe had a customer last month, said his cookies always burned even when he set the temperature real low. It turns out his Amana oven was running about 75 degrees hotter than what the control was set to. Temperature issues are frustrating.\nThe temperature sensor goes out of calibration. It's just a little probe sticking into the back of the oven cavity. It gets covered in grease and gunk over time. Sometimes it gets bent or damaged when people clean. If it's not in the right position or damaged, you get bad readings.\nLoose connections to the sensor cause temperature swings too. The computer thinks the oven is colder than it really is because it's getting intermittent readings. So it overshoots the temp you wanted.\nThe thermostat in older models gets sticky. Mechanical parts wear out. They don't cycle on and off like they should. Your oven just keeps getting hotter and hotter. That’s not good for that delicate pastry recipe.\nSchedule appliance repair service whenever you run into heating problems with your Amana oven.\nThe Door Won't Close Right\nOven doors take abuse over their life. Slammed shut. Kids hanging on them. Heavy roasting pans bumping into them. Eventually they get out of whack.\nHinges wear out or bend. The door doesn't sit flush anymore. Heat escapes around the edges. Your kitchen gets hot while your food doesn't. Sometimes you can adjust the hinges a bit, but usually they need replacement when they get bad.\nDoor springs weaken too. The door might drop suddenly instead of closing gently. Those springs help support the weight of the door. When they get weak, the hinges take more stress than they were designed for. Leads to more problems down the road.\nThe gasket around the door gets torn or compressed. Doesn't make a good seal anymore. Heat leaks out. Makes the oven work harder and your food take longer to cook. Gaskets can be replaced, but getting the old adhesive off is a pain in the neck.\nSelf-Cleaning Problems\nSelf-cleaning sounds great on paper. In practice, it's where a lot of problems start. Amanas are no exception.\n\nThe extreme heat during cleaning kills electronic parts. Control boards, switches, and wiring take a beating when the oven gets that hot. Sometimes they work fine for years, then you run self-clean once and something dies. That’s just the way it goes.\nDoor locks stick after cleaning. The lock is supposed to release when the oven cools down. Sometimes the mechanism gets gummed up or bent and the door stays locked. Not ideal when your oven is suddenly a vault you can't open.\nHeating elements give up during the clean cycle. All that extra heat pushes them past their breaking point, especially if they were already getting weak. Many repair guys will tell you to never use self-clean. Just wipe the oven out regular instead.\n\nBurners Acting Up\nCooktop burners have their own sets of problems, different ones for gas and electric models.\nGas burners clog up with food spills. The little holes get blocked and you see uneven flames or yellow tips instead of blue. Poking them clean with a pin helps sometimes, but you’ve got to be careful not to enlarge the holes.\nSpark igniters fail or get dirty. You hear them clicking but the burner won't light. Or they don't click at all. Food boils over and gums up the igniter. Clean them with a toothbrush and some alcohol. Beats replacing them.\nElectric coils have it rough. Stuff spills on them constantly. They're built to take it, but connections corrode over time. The burner receptacles where they plug in get burned or bent. Sometimes a burner works when you jiggle it just right, but that's a fire hazard waiting to happen.\nStrange Noises\nAmana ovens make all kinds of weird sounds when they're having trouble. Different noises mean different problems.\nBuzzing or humming usually points to something electrical. Relay switches buzz when they're not making good contact. The transformer hums louder than it should when it's going bad. Bad news either way.\nClicking repeatedly, not just when starting up, means a relay or switch is cycling on and off too fast. It could be a bad connection or failing part.\nGrinding noises from the convection fan mean the bearings are shot. Or something's come loose and is hitting the fan blade. Shut it off until it's fixed or you'll have a bigger problem.\nBooming when a gas oven ignites means gas built up before lighting. The igniter's weak or the gas flow needs adjustment. Not something to ignore - it can get dangerous.\nDigital Display Dead\nThe display screen just dies on some models. It goes completely blank or shows gibberish.\n\nPower glitches kill these displays sometimes. Try resetting the control board. Unplug the oven shut off the house circuit breaker for a few minutes. Restore power and see if the oven works. This simple fix sometimes works.\nRibbon cables work loose. They connect the display to the control board. Heat and time make them brittle or they just vibrate loose. Getting to them means taking apart the control panel. Not difficult but lots of small screws to keep track of.\nWater damage happens too. Steam from cooking gets into places it shouldn't. Condensation builds up inside the control panel. Eventually shorts something out. Doesn't help that many kitchens put the oven below the cooktop where all the steam rises past the controls.\n\nWhen To Call For Service\nSome Amana oven issues you can handle yourself. Cleaning burners, replacing light bulbs, maybe even changing the oven gasket if you're handy. Keep your manual handy. Save yourself a service call when it's something simple.\nBut for anything involving gas, electricity, or major disassembly, that's when calling us makes sense. Our techs have seen every Amana problem there is. Keeping your family safe matters more than saving a few bucks trying to fix a gas valve yourself.\nWe stock parts for all the common Amana problems. Can usually fix things in one visit. And we guarantee our work. No crossing your fingers hoping you fixed it right.\nGive us a call when your Amana needs professional attention. We'll get your kitchen back to normal without the headache. No more takeout needed.",

A service call involves diagnosing the appliance's malfunction and making repairs quickly. A repair technician can also recommend routine maintenance to extend your oven's life.\\n\\nWe work on Amana ovens all the time. While mostly a reliable appliance, your oven can eventually break at any time.\\n\\nAfter thousands of service visits, we've identified several issues that tend to frustrate homeowners most.\\n\\n## Oven Not Heating Up \\n\\nTurn the oven on and wait. And wait. And nothing happens. No heat. This happens with Amanas more than you'd think. It’s usually caused by a few common culprits. \\n\\n * The igniter gets weak over time. It's supposed to glow hot enough to open the gas valve, but after a few years they just can't get hot enough anymore. You might see it glowing orange but the burner never lights. Or sometimes it takes forever to light, way longer than it should. Igniters aren't cheap parts, but they're the most common thing to fail on gas Amana ovens. \\n* Electric models have different problems. The bake element might be burned out. Look for holes or blisters in the element, or spots where it's clearly broken. They don't always show obvious damage though. Sometimes they look fine but are dead inside. Like some people I've worked with over the years. \\n* Broken wires happen too. The oven gets hot, then cold, over and over for years. Wires get brittle. Connections work loose. One bad connection anywhere in the circuit and the whole oven won't heat. \\n\\n## Control Board Problems \\n\\nControl boards go bad in the newer electronic models. Everything looks normal on the display, but no command ever reaches the heating elements. These boards hate power surges. One good lightning storm and they're fried. Replacing them isn't a simple job. They cost a fair bit too, sometimes almost half what a new oven would run you. \\n\\nSchedule [wall oven repair](/repair/oven-repair-service) when the control won’t work on your Amana oven.\\n\\n## Temperature All Wrong \\n\\nWe had a customer last month, said his cookies always burned even when he set the temperature real low. It turns out his Amana oven was running about 75 degrees hotter than what the control was set to. Temperature issues are frustrating. \\n\\nThe temperature sensor goes out of calibration. It's just a little probe sticking into the back of the oven cavity. It gets covered in grease and gunk over time. Sometimes it gets bent or damaged when people clean. If it's not in the right position or damaged, you get bad readings. \\n\\nLoose connections to the sensor cause temperature swings too. The computer thinks the oven is colder than it really is because it's getting intermittent readings. So it overshoots the temp you wanted. \\n\\nThe thermostat in older models gets sticky. Mechanical parts wear out. They don't cycle on and off like they should. Your oven just keeps getting hotter and hotter. That’s not good for that delicate pastry recipe. \\n\\nSchedule [appliance repair](/repair) service whenever you run into heating problems with your Amana oven.\\n\\n## The Door Won't Close Right \\n\\nOven doors take abuse over their life. Slammed shut. Kids hanging on them. Heavy roasting pans bumping into them. Eventually they get out of whack. \\n\\nHinges wear out or bend. The door doesn't sit flush anymore. Heat escapes around the edges. Your kitchen gets hot while your food doesn't. Sometimes you can adjust the hinges a bit, but usually they need replacement when they get bad. \\n\\nDoor springs weaken too. The door might drop suddenly instead of closing gently. Those springs help support the weight of the door. When they get weak, the hinges take more stress than they were designed for. Leads to more problems down the road. \\n\\nThe gasket around the door gets torn or compressed. Doesn't make a good seal anymore. Heat leaks out. Makes the oven work harder and your food take longer to cook. Gaskets can be replaced, but getting the old adhesive off is a pain in the neck. \\n\\n## Self-Cleaning Problems \\n\\nSelf-cleaning sounds great on paper. In practice, it's where a lot of problems start. Amanas are no exception. \\n\\n* The extreme heat during cleaning kills electronic parts. Control boards, switches, and wiring take a beating when the oven gets that hot. Sometimes they work fine for years, then you run self-clean once and something dies. That’s just the way it goes. \\n* Door locks stick after cleaning. The lock is supposed to release when the oven cools down. Sometimes the mechanism gets gummed up or bent and the door stays locked. Not ideal when your oven is suddenly a vault you can't open. \\n* Heating elements give up during the clean cycle. All that extra heat pushes them past their breaking point, especially if they were already getting weak. Many repair guys will tell you to never use self-clean. Just wipe the oven out regular instead. \\n\\n## Burners Acting Up \\n\\nCooktop burners have their own sets of problems, different ones for gas and electric models. \\n\\nGas burners clog up with food spills. The little holes get blocked and you see uneven flames or yellow tips instead of blue. Poking them clean with a pin helps sometimes, but you’ve got to be careful not to enlarge the holes. \\n\\nSpark igniters fail or get dirty. You hear them clicking but the burner won't light. Or they don't click at all. Food boils over and gums up the igniter. Clean them with a toothbrush and some alcohol. Beats replacing them. \\n\\nElectric coils have it rough. Stuff spills on them constantly. They're built to take it, but connections corrode over time. The burner receptacles where they plug in get burned or bent. Sometimes a burner works when you jiggle it just right, but that's a fire hazard waiting to happen. \\n\\n## Strange Noises \\n\\nAmana ovens make all kinds of weird sounds when they're having trouble. Different noises mean different problems. \\n\\nBuzzing or humming usually points to something electrical. Relay switches buzz when they're not making good contact. The transformer hums louder than it should when it's going bad. Bad news either way. \\n\\nClicking repeatedly, not just when starting up, means a relay or switch is cycling on and off too fast. It could be a bad connection or failing part. \\n\\nGrinding noises from the convection fan mean the bearings are shot. Or something's come loose and is hitting the fan blade. Shut it off until it's fixed or you'll have a bigger problem. \\n\\nBooming when a gas oven ignites means gas built up before lighting. The igniter's weak or the gas flow needs adjustment. Not something to ignore - it can get dangerous. \\n\\n## Digital Display Dead \\n\\nThe display screen just dies on some models. It goes completely blank or shows gibberish. \\n\\n* Power glitches kill these displays sometimes. Try resetting the control board. Unplug the oven shut off the house circuit breaker for a few minutes. Restore power and see if the oven works. This simple fix sometimes works. \\n* Ribbon cables work loose. They connect the display to the control board. Heat and time make them brittle or they just vibrate loose. Getting to them means taking apart the control panel. Not difficult but lots of small screws to keep track of. \\n* Water damage happens too. Steam from cooking gets into places it shouldn't. Condensation builds up inside the control panel. Eventually shorts something out. Doesn't help that many kitchens put the oven below the cooktop where all the steam rises past the controls. \\n\\n## When To Call For Service \\n\\nSome Amana oven issues you can handle yourself. Cleaning burners, replacing light bulbs, maybe even changing the oven gasket if you're handy. Keep your manual handy. Save yourself a service call when it's something simple. \\n\\nBut for anything involving gas, electricity, or major disassembly, that's when calling us makes sense. Our techs have seen every Amana problem there is.

        "content": "self.__next_f.push([1,\"## What Is a Potentiometer?\\n\\nA potentiometer, often referred to as a \\\"pot,\\\" is a three-terminal device that acts as a variable resistor or voltage divider. It consists of:\\n\\n* __Resistive Element:__ A strip of material (such as carbon or a composite) with a uniform resistance.\\n* __Sliding Contact (Wiper):__ A movable arm that glides along the resistive element.\\n* __Terminals:__\\n     * Two fixed terminals connected to either end of the resistive element.\\n     * One terminal connected to the wiper, which adjusts the resistance.\\n\\nBy moving the wiper, you can change the resistance or voltage output, making the potentiometer ideal for controlling variables such as temperature or light intensity.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How Does a Potentiometer Work in an Oven?\\n\\nIn ovens, the potentiometer is often integrated into the temperature control knob. Here's how it works:\\n\\n* When you turn the knob, the potentiometer’s wiper moves along the resistive element, altering the resistance.\\n* This change in resistance adjusts the voltage supplied to the oven’s control system, which interprets the signal and modulates the heating elements accordingly.\\n* Set the pointer on the potentiometer knob to the desired temperature scale position that surrounds the knob on the control panel. The control panel in some ovens provides a digital display of the potentiometer temperature setting. \\n\\nThe potentiometer give you precise control of the oven temperature setting.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Key Benefits of Potentiometers in Ovens\\n\\n### Precision\\n\\nPotentiometers enable fine adjustments to the oven’s settings, allowing for exact temperature control—essential for baking and roasting.\\n\\n### Durability\\n\\nHigh-quality potentiometers are robust and can withstand the repetitive motions of everyday use, as well as the heat and vibrations present in an oven's environment.\\n\\n### Simplicity\\n\\nUnlike more complex digital controls, potentiometers are straightforward to use and repair, making them cost-effective and reliable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Potentiometers vs. Digital Controls: Why They Still Matter\\n\\nWith the rise of digital touchscreens and programmable controls, you might wonder why potentiometers are still in use. The answer lies in their simplicity and reliability.\\n\\n* __Cost-Effectiveness:__ Potentiometers are cheaper to produce and integrate than advanced digital systems.\\n* __Ease of Repair:__ A faulty potentiometer can often be replaced without the need for complicated and difficult diagnostics.\\n* __Tactile Preference:__ Many users prefer the analog feel of turning a knob, especially for tasks like baking.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Maintenance Tips for Oven Potentiometers\\n\\nTo keep your oven's potentiometer in good condition, follow these expert tips.\\n\\n### Maintenance and Cleaning\\n\\n* __Clean Regularly:__ Dust or grease can accumulate on and around the knob, interfering with smooth operation. Use a soft cloth and mild cleaner to wipe it down. Follow any additional instructions provided in your oven’s user guide to keep the potentiometer clean.\\n* __ Inspect the Knob:__ Check for cracks, damage, or excessive play in the knob. Replace the knob if it’s loose or damaged.\\n* __Replace the Potentiometer When Necessary:__ If the potentiometer becomes unresponsive or erratic, schedule [oven repair](/repair/oven-repair-service) service to have a service technician install a new one.\\n* __Schedule Professional Oven Maintenance:__ To keep your oven and the potentiometer in top shape and working properly, schedule professional [oven maintenance](/maintain) yearly.\\n\\n### Calibrating or Adjusting the Potentiometer\\n\\nOver time, the temperature setting on your oven can drift away from the factory setting. When this happens you'll find that your oven consistently bakes or roasts food faster or slower than the time specified in the recipe.\\n\\nFortunately, you can recalibrate your oven temperature potentiometer to get it closer to the original accurate setting.\\n\\n#### First, find the oven’s average temperature\\n\\nTo know how much to adjust the temperature, you’ll need to know how far off your oven’s actual average temperature is from the temperature you set.\\n\\n*You’ll need an accurate oven thermometer for this task.*\\n\\nBecause the oven temperature rises and falls around the set temperature as the element or burner cycles on and off, you’ll need to record oven thermometer readings several times to accurately determine actual oven temperature. The more readings you take, the more accurate the average you calculate will be ([oven repair](/repair/oven-repair-service) technicians often take at least 5 readings). \\n\\nFollow these steps to accurately find the actual oven temperature:\\n\\n1. Put the oven thermometer on the middle rack and set the oven to 350 degrees. \\n2. Let the oven preheat and then wait at least 10 minutes more for the temperature to level out from the preheating temperature spike.\\n3. Check the oven thermometer reading by looking through the oven window and record the temperature on a sheet of paper.\\n4. Wait 10 minutes and record another oven thermometer reading. Continue taking several more readings every 10 minutes.\\n5. After recording the actual temperature readings from the oven thermometer, add the readings and divide by the number of readings you took to determine the actual oven temperature.\\n\\n#### Set the temperature offset to make up for the difference\\n\\nThe difference between 350 degrees F and the average temperature you measured is the offset you'll use to recalibrate the oven potentiometer. \\n\\nFor example, if the average was 330 degrees F, the offset is +20 degrees; if the average was 380 degrees F, the offset is -30 degrees.\\n\\nYou can adjust most oven potentiometers by about 35 degrees in either direction. If the average temperature is off by more than 35 degrees, you may need to replace the potentiometer.\\n\\nHere are instructions for adjusting the potentiometer in common types of ovens. The exact steps vary by manufacturer, so check your owner's manual for instructions for your model.\\n\\n1. Pull off the temperature control knob. \\n2. On the back of the control knob you’ll find small adjustment screws and a pointer in a track. The back of the knob may be labeled Cooler at one end and Hotter at the other.\\n3. Loosen the screws just enough that you can move the pointer.\\n4. Move the pointer toward Cooler if the oven overcooks or Hotter if it undercooks. Each audible click adjusts set temperature about 10 degrees.\\n5. Tighten the screw and replace the knob.\\n\\nHere’s an image to illustrate the temperature adjustment:\\n\\n![how-to-calibrate-a-potentiometer](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/1mrbDZk9lhP4ClSlaY9h4a/adeef9c09826ef50594498346ab5c35d/calibrating-an-oven-potentiometer.png)\\n\\nRepeat the process for checking the actual average temperature. Continue adjusting the potentiometer until actual average oven temperature matches the set temperature on the potentiometer.\\n\\nIf you’re unable to calibrate the potentiometer on your own, schedule [appliance repair](/repair) service and we’ll send a Sears Home Services technician to your home to adjust the temperature or replace the potentiometer for you.\\n\\nUnderstanding how a potentiometer works and how to adjust it when necessary can help your baked goods to turn out perfect every time.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAt Sears Home Services, we’re always standing by to help you get the most out of your oven and all of your home appliances.

These ovens use advanced technology to improve heat distribution, making them ideal for a wide variety of cooking tasks.\\n\\n### How Convection Ovens Work\\n\\nAt the heart of a convection oven are three main components: the heating element, a fan, and an exhaust system. Together, they create an environment where food cooks more evenly and efficiently. Here’s how it all comes together:\\n\\n- **Heating Element**: Located at the bottom or top of the oven, the heating element generates the high temperatures needed for cooking.\\n- **Fan**: Positioned at the back of the oven, the fan continuously circulates the heated air, spreading it evenly throughout the oven cavity. This airflow eliminates hot and cold spots, so every part of your dish cooks uniformly.\\n- **Exhaust System**: This system helps remove excess moisture and maintains the right humidity levels, which improves browning and crisping.\\n\\nBy keeping the temperature consistent and circulating hot air around the food, convection ovens deliver faster and more reliable results. This technology is particularly useful for baking cookies, roasting meats, and achieving a perfectly caramelized finish on vegetables.\\n\\n### Key Differences from Conventional Ovens\\n\\nThe main difference between a convection oven and a conventional oven lies in how heat is distributed. Conventional ovens rely on radiant heat that comes from a single source, such as a heating element at the bottom. This setup can lead to uneven cooking, with certain areas of the oven becoming hotter than others. \\n\\nConvection ovens, on the other hand, use a fan to actively circulate hot air. This key difference results in more consistent heat distribution, which brings several advantages:\\n- **Faster Cooking Times**: The constant airflow speeds up the cooking process, often allowing you to reduce cooking times by up to 25%.\\n- **Even Heat Distribution**: With hot air continuously moving, there’s no need to worry about rotating pans or dealing with undercooked spots.\\n- **Lower Cooking Temperatures**: The efficiency of heat transfer means you can often use a lower temperature setting, saving energy without sacrificing results.\\n\\nThese differences make convection ovens a valuable tool for home cooks and professional chefs alike, providing reliability and precision in the kitchen.\\n\\n![How does a convection oven work_convection oven](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/1Ie5DEM9yJ8jwqtAsaVZoR/0807410cfdd331a19bd2b585360e9b53/How_does_a_convection_oven_work_convection_oven.jpg)\\n\\n## Advantages of Using a Convection Oven\\n\\nConvection ovens are highly valued for their impressive cooking performance and efficiency. They provide a range of benefits that make them a favorite among home cooks and culinary professionals alike.\\n\\n### Faster and Even Cooking\\n\\nOne of the biggest advantages of a convection oven is its ability to cook food quickly and evenly. The continuous circulation of hot air through the oven cavity accelerates the cooking process. This constant airflow distributes the heat uniformly, so there are no hot or cold spots. As a result, dishes like roasted meats turn out perfectly browned on the outside and juicy on the inside, while baked goods achieve a beautiful golden finish.\\n\\nThis faster cooking process not only saves time but also improves the texture and appearance of your meals. Whether you’re roasting a whole chicken or baking a delicate soufflé, the consistent heat provided by a convection oven provides reliable and even results.\\n\\n### Energy Efficiency\\n\\nEnergy savings is a major benefit of convection ovens. Because the circulating hot air speeds up cooking, you can often reduce both the temperature setting and the cooking time. For example, many recipes let you lower the temperature by about 25 degrees Fahrenheit, which translates to less energy consumption.\\n\\nShorter cooking times mean that the oven doesn’t need to work as hard or stay on as long, which can lead to noticeable savings on energy bills over time. Using a convection oven is an efficient choice that benefits both your kitchen routine and your wallet.\\n\\n### Versatility\\n\\nAnother standout feature of convection ovens is their versatility. These ovens can handle multiple dishes at once without the worry of flavors transferring. Thanks to the even heat distribution, you can bake cookies on one rack while roasting vegetables on another, and each dish will cook to perfection. The fan keeps aromas and flavors from mingling, which is especially useful when preparing meals for large gatherings or experimenting with different recipes.\\n\\nThis flexibility lets you maximize oven space and prepare multiple dishes simultaneously, making meal preparation more efficient and stress-free. Whether you’re hosting a dinner party or simply cooking for the family, a convection oven can help streamline your time in the kitchen.\\n\\n## Tips for Using a Convection Oven Effectively\\n\\nGetting the best results from your convection oven requires a few adjustments and thoughtful choices. Here are some practical tips for perfectly cooked meals every time.\\n\\n### Choosing the Right Bakeware and Cookware\\n\\nThe type of bakeware and cookware you use greatly impacts the performance of your convection oven. For optimal airflow and even cooking, shallow, rimmed pans or baking sheets are your best options. These let the hot air circulate more efficiently around the food, helping to achieve that ideal crispy or golden finish.\\n\\nOn the other hand, deep pans or covered dishes can disrupt the airflow and result in uneven cooking. Avoid using bakeware that blocks air circulation, as it can lead to undercooked centers or overcooked edges. Opt for lightweight metal or glass dishes that work well with the convection oven’s heat distribution.\\n\\n### Adapting Recipes for Convection Cooking\\n\\nConvection ovens often require slight adjustments to standard recipes. Because these ovens cook food faster and at a more even temperature, you’ll usually need to lower the temperature by about 25 degrees Fahrenheit. A 25% reduction in cooking times may be necessary, so it’s important to keep a close eye on your dishes as they cook. \\n\\nIf you’re trying a new recipe, start checking for doneness a few minutes earlier than you would in a conventional oven. Experiment with small adjustments to find what works best for your oven and your favorite dishes. With a bit of practice, you’ll be able to master any recipe with ease.\\n\\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\\n\\nUsing a convection oven effectively means avoiding some common pitfalls. One of the biggest mistakes is overcrowding the oven. Proper air circulation is a must for even cooking, so leave enough space between pans for the hot air to flow freely. If you pack the oven too tightly, you risk uneven results.\\n\\nPreheating is also important with a convection oven. Starting with a hot oven provides consistent temperatures throughout the cooking process. Avoid using aluminum foil or covering dishes with lids. These can block the airflow, preventing your food from cooking evenly or getting the crisp texture that convection ovens are known for.\\n\\nBy understanding these tips and making small adjustments, you can take full advantage of everything your convection oven has to offer.\\n\\n![How does a convection oven work_inside with cookies](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/7Idldo0uaUaE3thECi2OR4/b5b3cc7a55bbbe0e529cf18915ab6ab0/How_does_a_convection_oven_work_inside_with_cookies.jpg)\\n\\n## Caring for a Convection Oven\\n\\nConsistent performance and long-lasting use of your convection oven starts with keeping it in shape.
