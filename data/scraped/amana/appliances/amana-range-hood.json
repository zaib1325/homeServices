It contributes to functionality of cooking, safety and sometimes aesthetic appeal. \\n\\nThe primary purpose of a range hood is to remove smoke, odors, grease, and other airborne particles produced during cooking, thereby maintaining a clean and healthy kitchen environment.\\n\\nVentilation is a critical factor in kitchen design, and range hoods play a significant role in ensuring proper ventilation. Effective ventilation prevents the buildup of harmful gases like carbon monoxide and reduces the risk of fire hazards. It also helps control excess humidity, which can lead to mold and mildew growth.\\n\\nThere are various types of range hoods available, each with distinct features and benefits. \\n\\n* Venting of range hoods includes ducted and ductless designs.\\n* Ducted range hoods connect to an external ventilation system, expelling air outside. \\n* Conversely, ductless range hoods use activated carbon filters to trap contaminants and odors and then recirculate air back into the kitchen. \\n* Many range hoods can be installed either way.\\n\\nWhen selecting a range hood, consider factors such as your kitchen layout, the size of your cooking area, and your personal preferences. Consulting with a professional can help ensure you choose the right range hood for your specific needs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![how-a-ductless-range-hood-works-image](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/5HqoEBEbhweeoOsOKLMUT8/81ec42f463b73e9e0889d4ab3dca9a1c/range-hood-eliminating-smoke-image.png)\\n\\n## How a Ductless Range Hood Works\\n\\nA ductless range hood, also known as a recirculating range hood, is often installed in kitchens that don’t have easy access to venting exhaust air to the outside of the home. \\n\\nInstead of venting air outside through a duct system, a ductless range hood recirculates the air back into the kitchen.\\n\\nThe carbon air filter installed in a ductless range hood scrubs contaminants from recirculating exhaust air to keep the air in your kitchen clean and free from smoke, grease, and odors during cooking. \\n\\nThis process typically involves three main components:\\n\\n### 1. Grease Filters \\n\\nThese metal mesh filters capture and remove grease particles from the suction air, preventing grease buildup on surfaces and keeping the kitchen clean.\\n\\nAlthough you’ll find the grease filters in both ducted and ductless range hoods, the grease filters in ductless range hoods are essential for keeping air moving smoothly through recirculation air in ductless range hoods. Removing as much grease as possible helps keep the carbon filter from getting clogged.\\n\\nCleaning the grease filters regularly in a ductless range hood will ensure proper air recirculation and filtering of kitchen air.\\n\\n### 2. Charcoal Filters\\n\\nResponsible for capturing and removing odors, the activated charcoal in these ductless recirculation filters absorbs odorous particles, leaving the air fresh and odor-free.\\n\\nCharcoal filters must be replaced regularly to keep kitchen air clean. \\n\\nUnlike grease filters, charcoal filters in ductless range hoods __cannot__ be cleaned. They must be replaced when their filter media is used up to help keep kitchen air fresh and clean.\\n\\n### 3. Recirculation Fan\\n\\nThe range hood's fan draws in air from the cooking area and pushes it through the filters. The filtered air is then recirculated back into the kitchen, creating a cleaner and more comfortable cooking environment.\\n\\nKeeping the grease filters clean and replacing the charcoal filter on time helps the recirculation fan move the designed volume of air through the filters to keep kitchen air fresh and safe.\\n\\nWhen choosing a ductless range hood, it's important to select one with a high-volume fan and high-quality charcoal filters for optimal contaminant and odor removal. [Sears](https://www.sears.com/) offers a range of ductless range hoods with advanced charcoal filters, designed to deliver powerful odor control for a cleaner and fresher kitchen environment.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Pros, Cons, and Cost Considerations of Ductless Range Hoods\\n\\nWhen selecting a range hood for your kitchen, ductless range hoods offer unique advantages. One of the main benefits is their installation flexibility. Unlike ducted range hoods that require ductwork to vent outside, ductless range hoods can be installed anywhere in your kitchen without extensive renovations. This makes them an excellent option for homes without existing ductwork or for those seeking a more convenient installation process.\\n\\nAnother advantage of ductless range hoods is their ability to improve indoor air quality. These hoods are equipped with filters that capture grease, odors, and smoke, preventing them from recirculating back into your kitchen. By effectively removing these contaminants, ductless range hoods help create a cleaner and healthier cooking environment.\\n\\nHowever, there are also disadvantages to consider. Since they don't vent outside, ductless range hoods might not be as efficient in removing heat and moisture from your kitchen compared to ducted models. If you often cook with high heat or produce a lot of steam, a ductless range hood may not be the most effective option.\\n\\nCost is another factor to consider. Ductless range hoods typically have a lower upfront cost compared to ducted models since they don't require ductwork. However, they do require regular filter replacements, which can add up over time. It's essential to factor in these ongoing maintenance costs when evaluating the overall cost of a ductless range hood.\\n\\nWhen choosing a ductless range hood, consider factors such as the hood's airflow capacity relative to your kitchen size. A hood with insufficient airflow may not effectively remove pollutants from the air. Additionally, consider the noise level of the hood, especially if you have an open-concept kitchen. Look for a model that offers adjustable fan speeds and quiet operation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![maintaining-a-ductless-range-hood](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/6grfEVQ7Js4bzkeW9ZleOM/b4bc2e0e40aa5f727639fb7c8b595d4b/maintaining-a-range-hood-image.png)\\n\\n## Recommended Maintenance\\n\\nProper [range hood maintenance](/maintain) is crucial to ensure the optimal performance and longevity of your ductless range hood.

However, when you find the range hood not working, it can lead to frustration and concern. Understanding the common failures that occur with vent hoods, such as no power at all, fans refusing to spin or struggling to pull air, or lights that simply refuse to illuminate, fear not. You may be able to fix the range hood yourself as we delve into the potential problems and solutions.\\n\\n### Why Won’t My Range Hood Won’t Power Up?\\n\\nIf you find the range hood is completely dead, start with the obvious by ensuring the power cord is plugged into the electrical outlet. If it’s plugged in but not working, try checking the outlet by unplugging the range hood and testing the outlet with a hair dryer or night light. If the outlet is dead, check and reset the house circuit breaker, then recheck the outlet. If it’s still not working, you’ll need to contact an electrician for assistance.\\n\\nIf the outlet is working, you’ll likely need to schedule [range hood repair](/repair/range-hood-repair-service) with a Sears Home Services expert.\\n\\n### Why Doesn’t My Range Hood’s Fan Work?\\n\\n#### Fan Doesn’t Turn On\\nWhen the blower fan doesn’t even turn on but the lights work, a failed electronic control board, faulty user interface, bad fan switch, wiring failure or failed fan motor can keep a range hood fan from running.\\n\\nIf you’re confident that you can troubleshoot the problem yourself, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Unplug the range hood and check the wire harness connections between the control and the fan motor. Reconnect any loose wires and repair any damaged wires. With the range hood still unplugged, check the electronic control board for burn marks that indicate a control board failure and replace the control board if you find burn marks on the circuit board.\\n2. If your range hood uses a user interface control to start the fan, you may need to replace the user interface if it isn't sending signals to the electronic control board when you press the fan button. A user interface control is a keypad and display panel that sends signals to the electronic control board through a ribbon wire cable when you press its selection buttons. DIY testing of the user interface control isn't available for most range hoods. If the electronic control board doesn't activate the fan when you press the fan button on the user interface control, you'll likely need to replace the electronic control board. If the fan still doesn't work after replacing the electronic control board, you'll likely need to replace the user interface control.\\n3. If your range hood uses a switch to activate the fan motor, test the fan switch for continuity using a multimeter (with the range hood still unplugged) to see if the switch allows current to flow to the fan when you turn the switch on. Replace the fan switch if you measure no continuity through the switch with the switch turned on. If the switch or the electronic control board sends current to the fan motor but the fan motor doesn't run, you’ll likely need to replace the fan motor (if the wires between the switch and the fan are good).\\n\\nHere’s a video that shows how to check continuity using a multimeter:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R6DgIA_ikQQ\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nIf you get to a point where you need to have a professional diagnose and repair the range hood, [schedule a service call through Sears Home Services](/repair).\\n\\n#### Fan Doesn’t Pull Much Air\\n\\nWhen your range hood fan runs but it isn't pulling much air, clogged air filters, air duct problems, a fan motor failure or a broken fan blade could be causing poor air suction.\\n\\nFollow these DIY troubleshooting steps to resolve an air suction problem with your range hood:\\n\\n1. If your range hood exhausts some air to the outside of your home, check the condition of the grease filters. Wash or replace the grease filters if dirty. \\n2. Check the air damper on the vent duct cap attached to the outside of your house. That air damper keeps outside air from flowing into your home when the range hood fan isn't running. Repair or replace the air damper if it doesn't open to allow range hood exhaust air to flow out of the exhaust duct.\\n3. Examine the damper above the fan in the range hood to make sure that damper opens properly to allow air to flow out through the exhaust duct system. You can use the installation instructions for your range hood to access and check that damper. \\n4. Check the fan blade for damage because a damaged fan blade won't move air through the range hood properly. Replace the fan blade if damaged. \\n5. A weak fan motor won't turn the fan blade at the right speed to move air through the range hood. If the fan motor makes noise or doesn't turn the fan blade at full speed when activated, replace the fan motor.\\nIf your range hood recirculates the air back into the kitchen (non-ducted installation) and uses a charcoal recirculation filter, a clogged filter can diminish airflow through the range hood. Replace the charcoal filter if you haven't replaced it according to the guidelines in your owner's manual. Next, check the condition of the grease filters and wash or replace the grease filters if dirty. Check the damper above the fan to make sure it opens properly so exhaust air can pass through the damper and recirculation filter. Repair or replace the air damper if it's stuck closed. Check the fan blade for damage and replace the fan blade if damaged. If the fan motor makes noise or doesn't turn the fan blade at full speed when activated, replace the fan motor.\\n\\nIf you get to a point where you need to have a professional diagnose and fix your range hood, [schedule a Sears Technician to visit your home and repair the range hood](/repair).\\n\\n### Why Won’t My Range Hood’s Lights Work?\\n\\nFailures such as a defective electronic control board, bad user interface control, broken light switch, bad light bulb sockets or a wiring failure can prevent the lights from working.\\n\\nFollow these DIY troubleshooting steps to resolve lighting problems with your range hood:\\n\\n1. Unplug the range hood and check the wire harness connections between the light sockets and the control board or light switch. Reconnect any loose wires and repair any broken wires. \\n2. If the light socket wiring is okay, check the electronic control board for burn marks. Replace the control board if you see burn marks because the burn marks indicate a control board failure.\\n3. If your range hood uses a user interface control to control the lights, you may need to replace the user interface if it isn't sending signals to the electronic control board when you press user interface buttons.\\n4. DIY testing of the user interface control isn't available for most range hood models. If the electronic control board doesn't activate the lights, you'll likely need to replace the electronic control board. If the lights still don't work after replacing the control board, you'll likely need to replace the user interface control.\\n5. If your range hood uses a switch to control the lights, unplug the range hood and test the switch for continuity using a multimeter to see if the switch allows current to flow to the lights when you turn the switch on. Replace the switch if you don't measure continuity through the switch when it's turned on.\\n6. With new light bulbs installed and the range hood unplugged, check for continuity through the light sockets with new light bulbs installed. Replace the sockets if you don't measure continuity through the sockets with new bulbs installed.\\n\\n## Troubleshooting Your Range Hood Issues\\n\\nThese DIY troubleshooting steps will help you resolve problems in most types of range hoods installed over the range or cooktop. But if these steps don’t help you fix the problem, [schedule an appointment](/repair) with a Sears range hood expert to repair it.\\n\\n## What is the Life Expectancy of a Range Hood?\\n\\nDepending on the model and how frequently you use it, the average lifespan of a range hood is 15 years. With proper care, some range hoods can last up to 20 years.\\n\\n## How Can I Improve My Kitchen Hood?\\n\\nKeeping the range hood and filters is the single-most important factor in improving range hood performance. A clogged filter prevents airflow through the vent system and places undue strain on the fan motor. Grease splatters left on surfaces of the range hood could, over time, cause damage to the finish. \\n\\n## Sears Home Services Can Assess and Fix Your Range Hood Issues\\n\\nSears Home Services has been helping American home owners for decades with their appliance repair needs.

Let's dive into why this task is so important, the benefits of regular cleaning, and how dirty filters can impact your range hood's performance.\\n\\nFirstly, clean range hood filters significantly improve air quality in your kitchen. Cooking releases grease, smoke, and odors into the air, which the filters trap. Over time, these filters can become clogged, leading to poor air circulation and unpleasant lingering odors.\\n\\nRegular cleaning also prevents grease and grime buildup, which can be a fire hazard. Clean filters ensure your range hood operates at its best, effectively removing smoke and steam. This is especially important in open-concept kitchens or where the range hood is near living or dining areas, helping to maintain a comfortable, odor-free environment.\\n\\nDirty filters restrict airflow, making it harder for the range hood to remove smoke, steam, and odors. This can result in increased cooking smells, excess moisture, and a greasy film on cabinets and countertops.\\n\\nBy regularly cleaning your range hood filters, you ensure your kitchen remains clean, fresh, and free from harmful airborne particles. Always follow the manufacturer's cleaning instructions or consult a professional if unsure about the proper method for your specific range hood model.\\n\\n### Materials and Tools Needed\\n\\nTo effectively clean greasy range hood filters, gather the following materials and tools:\\n\\n* Dishwashing liquid or degreaser. You can also use baking soda.\\n* Hot water in a large stock pot or bucket.\\n* Old towels or newspaper.\\n* Soft-bristle brush or sponge.\\n* Gloves to protect your hands.\\n* Large mixing spoon.\\n* Microfiber cloth for wiping down the range hood.\\n* Scrub brush or toothbrush for hard-to-reach areas.\\n* Stainless steel cleaner if you have a stainless range hood.\\n\\nThese materials and tools are readily available at local home improvement stores or supermarkets. You can also find a wide range of cleaning products and tools on websites like searspartdirect.com to assist in your cleaning tasks.\\n\\n## 4 Expert Tips for Cleaning Greasy Range Hood Filters\\n\\nFollow these expert tips to clean grease off your range hood filters and keep them in top shape.\\n\\nPreparing the filters for cleaning:\\n\\n1. Turn off the range hood and unplug it to avoid any accidents during cleaning.\\n2. Remove the filters from the range hood. Most range hoods have easily removable filters that can be taken out by hand or with a screwdriver.\\n\\nTips for cleaning greasy filters:\\n\\n### Tip #1: Soak the Range Hood Filters in Hot Soapy Water\\n\\nFill a sink, bucket or large stock pot with hot water and add a few squirts of dish soap. Carefully stir the water with a large mixing spoon to mix the dish soap in the water. Place the filters in the soapy water and let them soak for at least 30 minutes. \\n\\nYou can use a degreaser or baking soda instead of dish soap in the hot water to clean extremely greasy range hood filters.\\n\\n### Tip #2: Gently Scrub the Grease Filters\\n\\nAfter soaking for 30 minutes, the hot water should now be warm so you can safely use a soft brush or sponge to scrub the filters, removing stubborn grease. Be careful not to damage the filters while scrubbing. Wear gloves to protect your hands while scrubbing the filters.\\n\\n### Tip #3: Rinse and Repeat\\n\\nRinse the filters under hot running water. If grease remains on the filters, boil more water and repeat the above process to clean residual grease from the filters.\\n\\nIf you haven’t clean the filters within the last several months (or years), it may take several iterations of soaking and scrubbing to completely remove the grease.\\n\\n### Tip #4: Drying the Range Hood Grease Filters\\n\\nAfter removing all grease from the filters and rinsing them under hot water, set the filters aside on a clean towel or drying rack to air dry naturally. Avoid using heat sources to speed up drying, as this may damage the filters.\\n\\nAllow the filters to air dry completely. \\n\\nOnce completely dry, carefully place the filters back into the range hood, ensuring they are securely fastened in their original position.\\n\\nBy following these simple tips, you can keep your range hood filters clean and ensure optimal range hood performance. Regularly cleaning your filters prevents grease buildup and maintains a healthy kitchen environment.\\n\\n__Clean the grease filters in your range hood every other month or more often if you fry foods often.__\\n\\n![Sears Home Services Range Hood Service image](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/3B0vynd5ZUVr9qgdDH88Xt/ade69c13d6d57deb5167faf141ebc2cc/Sears_Home_Services_Range_Hood_Repair_Service_image.png)\\n\\n## What to do if Your Range Hood Isn’t Working Properly\\n\\nAfter cleaning the range hood grease filters, air should flow freely through your range hood.\\n\\nIf your range hood isn’t working properly after cleaning the filters, [schedule range hood repair service and we’ll send a Sears Home Services technician to your home](/repair/range-hood-repair-service) to fix the problem.\\n\\nWhether you have a wall-mount, island or downdraft range hood, [Sears Home Services](/) is your best option for quick and easy kitchen ventilation repair.
