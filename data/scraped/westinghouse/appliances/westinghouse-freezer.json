You can start by checking the coils, inspecting the seals, or ensuring there are no obstructions in the vents.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;If the problem persists, it’s best to call a professional technician for diagnosis and repair.&lt;/p&gt;\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"How do I fix frost buildup in my Westinghouse freezer?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"&lt;p&gt;Frost buildup in a freezer, especially in automatic defrost models, is often a sign of a malfunctioning defrost system. This can involve the defrost heater, thermostat, or control board.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;For manual defrost freezers, frost buildup is normal but should be addressed when it exceeds 1/4 inch. In either case, you should clean the freezer, defrost it if needed, and check for issues with the door seals.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;If the frost continues to accumulate, set up &lt;a href=&quot;/repair/freezer-repair-service&quot;&gt;freezer repair&lt;/a&gt; to have a professional examine and fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"What causes unusual noises in my Westinghouse freezer?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"&lt;p&gt;Freezers can make various noises, and some are normal. However, excessive buzzing, clicking, rattling, or gurgling may indicate specific issues.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;For example, a clicking sound could point to a problem with the compressor relay or overload, while rattling might indicate loose components. Gurgling sounds could signal airflow issues or defrost system drain problems.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re hearing unusual noises and they’re accompanied by performance issues, it’s a good idea to schedule a service visit to get to the root of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"Why is my Westinghouse freezer leaking water?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"&lt;p&gt;Water leaks around your freezer can be caused by several issues, including clogged defrost drains, poor door seals, or improper leveling.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;If the defrost drain is blocked, water can overflow and leak onto the floor. Similarly, worn door seals allow warm air to enter, causing condensation that leaks out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Check that the freezer is level and that seals are intact. If the problem continues, a professional repair technician can help diagnose and fix the issue.&lt;/p&gt;\"}}]}",

        "content": "Frequently Asked QuestionsWhy is my Westinghouse freezer not keeping food frozen properly?There are several potential causes for temperature issues in your freezer, including dirty condenser coils, a malfunctioning compressor, a faulty defrost system, or damaged door seals.\nWhen your Westinghouse freezer isn't maintaining the proper temperature, it’s important to act quickly to prevent food loss. You can start by checking the coils, inspecting the seals, or ensuring there are no obstructions in the vents.\nIf the problem persists, it’s best to call a professional technician for diagnosis and repair.How do I fix frost buildup in my Westinghouse freezer?Frost buildup in a freezer, especially in automatic defrost models, is often a sign of a malfunctioning defrost system. This can involve the defrost heater, thermostat, or control board.\nFor manual defrost freezers, frost buildup is normal but should be addressed when it exceeds 1/4 inch. In either case, you should clean the freezer, defrost it if needed, and check for issues with the door seals.\nIf the frost continues to accumulate, set up freezer repair to have a professional examine and fix the problem.What causes unusual noises in my Westinghouse freezer?Freezers can make various noises, and some are normal. However, excessive buzzing, clicking, rattling, or gurgling may indicate specific issues.\nFor example, a clicking sound could point to a problem with the compressor relay or overload, while rattling might indicate loose components. Gurgling sounds could signal airflow issues or defrost system drain problems.\nIf you’re hearing unusual noises and they’re accompanied by performance issues, it’s a good idea to schedule a service visit to get to the root of the problem.Why is my Westinghouse freezer leaking water?Water leaks around your freezer can be caused by several issues, including clogged defrost drains, poor door seals, or improper leveling.\nIf the defrost drain is blocked, water can overflow and leak onto the floor. Similarly, worn door seals allow warm air to enter, causing condensation that leaks out.\nCheck that the freezer is level and that seals are intact. If the problem continues, a professional repair technician can help diagnose and fix the issue.",

If the air vents in your freezer are blocked or obstructed, it could disrupt the cold air flow, leading to uneven cooling. An improperly functioning thermostat or a malfunctioning temperature control could also be to blame. If the thermostat isn't doing its job properly, it could result in uneven temperature regulation in your freezer.\\n\\nAt Sears Home Services, we understand the importance of a properly functioning freezer. Our team of experts can diagnose and fix all your freezer related issues, including when your freezer does not freeze evenly. Don't hesitate to reach out to us.\\n\\n## Delving into the Possible Causes\\n\\nHere are some of the potential reasons why your freezer might not be freezing evenly.\\n\\n* __Incorrect temperature settings:__ Improper temperature settings are a common cause of uneven freezing. Make sure your freezer is set to the recommended temperature – typically 0 degrees F. Adjust the settings if necessary.\\n* __Loose or damaged door or lid seal:__ The door or lid gasket prevents warm air from entering the freezer and causing poor cooling. Check the lid or door gasket and replace the gasket if it’s cracked, torn or damaged.\\n* __Obstructed air vents:__ Blocked air vents inside the freezer can also lead to cooling problems. Don’t overload the freezer and avoid blocking air vents inside the freezer. Refer to the owner’s manual for help understanding where air vents are located inside your freezer.\\n* __Dirty condenser coils:__ If your freezer has condenser coils, keep the coils clean so the refrigerant system works properly. Dirt and dust on the coils will inhibit freezer cooling.\\n* __Ventilation problems:__ Maintain proper clearance around the freezer to prevent the compressor from overheating. Make sure that louvers in vents stay clean and unobstructed to promote efficient operation of the compressor and cooling system.\\n* __Frost issues:__ If your freezer doesn’t have an automatic defrost system, [manually defrost the freezer regularly](/blog/how-do-i-defrost-my-freezer-guide) to prevent cooling problems. If your model does have an automatic defrost system but it’s not working correctly, it could lead to uneven freezing. In such cases, you’ll likely need to [contact a professional appliance repair service like Sears Home Services to fix the problem](/repair/freezer-repair-service).\\n* __Evaporator fan failure:__ The evaporator fan circulates cooling air through the freezer for even cooling. When that fan fails, the bottom section of the freezer will cool properly but upper areas won’t cool well.\\n\\nAdditional problems such as lack or refrigerant or a blockage in refrigerant tubing can also cause uneven cooling in your freezer. These types of problems typically need to be diagnosed and repaired by a service technician. Don’t hesitate to schedule service when you encounter cooling problems in your freezer.\\n\\n## The Significance of Proper Air Circulation\\n\\nProper air circulation is crucial for your freezer to function optimally. If your freezer does not freeze evenly, it could be a sign of poor air circulation within the unit.\\n\\nProper air circulation aids in the even distribution of cold air throughout the freezer, maintaining a consistent temperature, which is vital for keeping your food fresh and preventing freezing issues.\\n\\nIf you notice uneven freezing in your freezer, try these steps to improve air circulation:\\n\\n* __Organize your freezer:__ Arrange items so that air can circulate freely. Avoid overstuffing the shelves and ensure there's enough space between food items.\\n* __Keep the vents clear:__ Check for any obstructions near the vents, such as food packaging or ice buildup. Rearrange items to prevent blocking supply and return air vents.\\n* __Defrost your freezer regularly:__ Ice buildup can restrict airflow and lead to uneven freezing. Defrost your freezer regularly to prevent this issue is you have a manual defrost freezer.\\n\\nIf you've followed these tips and are still facing the issue of your freezer not working properly, it might be time to consult a professional technician to diagnose and repair any underlying mechanical issues.\\n\\n## Maintain Your Freezer to Prevent Uneven Cooling\\n\\nCleaning and maintaining your freezer regularly will help prevent uneven cooling problems. Follow the maintenance recommendations in the owner’s manual to keep your freezer working properly. Here are some important maintenance tips to follow so your freezer works smoothly:\\n\\n* Keep the interior clean. Regular cleaning of the inside of your freezer is important so air circulates properly through the compartment.\\n* Clean the condenser coils if your freezer has them. Keeping those coils clean will help promote efficient cooling.\\n* Defrost the freezer regularly. If you have a manual defrost freezer, defrost the freezer at least once per year or when you see more than 1/4-inch of frost buildup on the freezer walls.\\n* Clean and maintain the door or lid gasket. Regularly inspect gasket for any signs of wear or damage and clean it using a mild detergent and warm water. Lightly coat the gasket with petroleum jelly to help preserve it and keep it lasting longer. Replace the gasket if it’s torn or damaged. Here’s a video that shows how to replace the gasket in common freezers:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p-Fka0oguPM\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nThat video shows how to replace the gasket on a refrigerator but the process is the same for many freezers. You may see screws under the gasket that hold it to the lid or door. Remove the screws to release the old gasket if necessary. Reinstall the screws to hold the new freezer gasket in place.\\n\\nWhen you need to have a service technician replace the freezer gasket or repair a cooling issue in your freezer, don’t hesitate to [schedule repair service](/repair/freezer-repair-service). We’ll send a Sears Home Services technician to your home to get your freezer back in top shape.\\n\"])",

We’ll help identify the likely causes of the most common freezer repairs.**\\n\\nHas your frozen food lost its chill? Is your meat so freezer-burnt it’s entirely white? Is the freezer moaning and groaning like Old Man Winter himself — or worse, not working at all?\\n\\nWhen your freezer isn’t freezing, it might not be a catastrophe requiring a repair or all-out replacement. Before calling in the [experts for a repair](/blog/how-to-fix-a-refrigerator-that-is-not-cooling-guide), you can sometimes do a little sleuthing yourself — armed with some inside information from the technicians at Sears.\\n\\nHere are the most common freezer problems that Sears’ experts see–and the likely culprits behind them.\\n\\n## Why is my freezer running but not freezing?\\n\\n### Overpacking\\n\\nEnsure there’s sufficient amount of product in the freezer section, but that it’s not jammed-packed. It’s recommended to keep the freezer 70% to 85% full. Too much stuff in there will limit air circulation within the appliance — and too little will cause all the cold air to spill out of the appliance every time it’s opened. Keep things evenly dispersed near the middle of the shelves so as not to block any vents or interfere with proper air circulation.\\n\\n### Frost Build-up\\n\\nFrost accumulating inside the freezer compartment can block the vents that carry cold air into the compartment. Most freezers today have auto defrost, so check to see if the door has been left open, or if the door seal is worn. You’ll need to have the seal replaced if it’s damaged or torn. If the seal looks okay, a technician should inspect the freezer to determine the problem. If your freezer doesn’t have auto-defrost, you should manually defrost it following the recommendations in your owner’s manual.\\n\\n### Dirty Condenser Coils\\n\\nDirty coils won’t cool down refrigerant before it enters the evaporator, resulting in poor cooling performance. Clean the condenser coils if they’re caked with lint and dust. You may need to have a service technician clean the condenser coils if they’re not easily accessible.\\n\\n### Broken Evaporator Fan Motor\\n\\nA failed evaporator fan can cause freezer cooling problems because it won’t circulate air through the freezer cabinet. You’ll need to have a service technician replace the evaporator fan if it doesn’t run when activated.\\n\\n### Broken Condenser Fan Motor\\n\\nFreezers with condenser coils may also have a condenser fan that pushes air across the condenser coils. The freezer won’t cool well when the condenser fan isn’t running while the evaporator is operating.\\n\\n### Freezer Compressor Not Working\\n\\nThe freezer compressor is a pump that moves refrigerant through the sealed system, creating the cold air. If the compressor or the compressor start relay stops working, the freezer won’t freeze. If you listen to the freezer for about 30 minutes but don’t hear the familiar hum when it operations, it’s possible the compressor is the problem. A certified refrigeration technician is required if the compressor fails. \\n\\n## Other Common Freezer Problems\\n\\n### Freezer Making Strange Noises\\n\\nA freezer during normal operation can make a variety of noises from clicking during the ice harvest cycle and sizzling or gurgling during defrost to swishing or whirring sounds from the fan motor.\\n\\nDiagnosing a noise complete can be very difficult. What sounds like humming on one day might sound like buzzing on another. Loudness is often relative; so what is considered loud at night time might be quiet during the day. And different conditions can cause the freezer to sound different.\\n\\nThe key question to ask yourself when hearing noises is are they any other issues going on with the freezer. If other issues are present, fixing those issues will more than likely also fix the noises.\\n\\n### Water Leaking Under Freezer\\n\\nThe most likely reason water is present under the freezer is a frozen-over defrost drain. If the drain is frozen, it should be defrosted and then cleaned out. \\n\\nIf the freezer has a water hookup for an ice maker and/or water dispenser, the leak could be coming from the house water supply, the water line, or the inlet valve. If the water line or inlet valve are faulty, they should be replaced.\\n\\nIf the water is coming from the freezer itself, it may be due to the condensation pan overfilling. Excess frost on the evaporator coil could produce more water than the pan can hold. This problem might be caused by high humidity areas or frequent opening of the freezer door. A missing access cover might also prevent proper air flow and proper evaporation of water from the pan. If the condensation pan is cracked, it should be replaced. Is your [refrigerator too cold freezer too warm](https://www.searshomeservices.com/symptom/refrigerator-too-cold-freezer-too-warm \\\"refrigerator too cold freezer too warm\\\")?\\n\\n### Freezer Won’t Run\\n\\nMake sure the appliance has power going to it. Check whether the light inside the refrigerator goes on when you open the door.\\n\\nIf not, plug something like a hairdryer or lamp into the outlet. If that device also doesn’t work, the outlet doesn’t have power going to it. Look for a tripped circuit breaker or tripped GFI outlet. Contact a licensed electrician for more serious electrical problems.\\n\\nMake sure the appliance has power going to it. Check whether the light inside the refrigerator goes on when you open the door.\\n\\nIf not, plug something like a hairdryer or lamp into the outlet. If that device also doesn’t work, the outlet doesn’t have power going to it. Look for a tripped circuit breaker or tripped GFI outlet. Contact a licensed electrician for more serious electrical problems.\\n\\nIf there’s power going to the outlet, there may be an issue with the main control or user interface boards, or the temperature-monitoring devices such as the sensors, or the thermostat might be bad. Further troubleshooting will be needed to pinpoint and resolve the issue.\\n\\n### Temperature Too Warm\\n\\nIf the freezer is freezing but your ice cream seems to soft, check the temperature setting is correct. The recommended setting for a freezer is 0°F (-18°C). \\n\\nThe freezer should be operated in an environment between 55°F (13°C) and 110°F (43°C). If the environment is too cold, the freezer may not get sufficient run time to maintain its temperature. If the temperature is too warm, the appliance will have a hard time getting the interior down to the desired temperature.\\n\\nDirty condenser coils or a broken fan motor can also cause insufficient freezing.\\n\\nHere are some additional explanations about why the freezer temperature is too warm.\\n\\n* Some freezers use a thermistor (temperature sensor) and an electronic control board to control freezer temperature. If the freezer cools but it doesn’t cool down to 0 degrees, a bad thermistor may not be accurately detecting freezer temperature or the electronic control board in the freezer may be inaccurately detecting the thermistor signal.\\n* A wiring failure in the thermistor circuit could be interfering with the thermistor signal going to the control board. The freezer won’t cool properly when the control board can’t accurate receive the thermistor signal.\\n* Some freezers use a defrost timer to control automatic defrost intervals. A failed timer won’t advance into the automatic defrost mode, so the defrost heating element will never turn on to melt frost off the evaporator fins.

If this drain gets clogged with ice or debris, water has nowhere to go and will eventually leak onto the floor.\\n\\n### How to Fix It:\\n\\n1. Unplug the freezer and locate the defrost drain, usually at the back inside panel.\\n2. Use a turkey baster or a small funnel to flush warm water down the drain to clear the clog.\\n3. If ice is blocking the drain, let the freezer sit unplugged for a few hours, or use a hairdryer on a low setting to melt the ice.\\n\\n![home-owner-checking-the-freezer-door-seal-image](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/6ktivOZ5euC6C7dA8GtenU/3c66aeceb479ed30fc4effe3e2c6b689/home-owner-checking-the-freezer-door-seal-image.png)\\n\\n## Door Seal Issues\\n\\nA loose or damaged door gasket can allow warm air to enter the freezer, causing excessive frost buildup. When the freezer runs a defrost cycle, this extra frost melts into a larger-than-normal amount of water. If the drain system can’t handle it, you may see water leaking from the base.\\n\\n### How to Fix It:\\n\\n1. Inspect the gasket for cracks, tears, or warping.\\n2. Close the door on a piece of paper—if you can pull it out easily, the seal isn’t tight.\\n3. Clean the gasket with warm soapy water and a soft cloth to remove any grime that could be preventing a good seal.\\n4. If the gasket is damaged, replace it to ensure a proper seal.\\n\\nHere’s a video that shows how to replace a gasket on a common type of freezer or refrigerator/freezer:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CCNbA_5CLcY\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n## Improper Freezer Leveling\\n\\nAn upright freezer should be slightly tilted backward so the doors close easily and water from the defrost cycle flows correctly into the drain. If the unit is too level or leaning forward, water can spill out of the drain area before it reaches the pan.\\n\\n![leveling-a-refrigerator](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/2JOMyBZ5KvftwqpAHmUKhU/143a0649e0dc4b518689eaf64d7d90d1/adjust-refrigerator-leveling-legs.png)\\n\\n### How to Fix It:\\n\\n* Use a level to check if your freezer tilts slightly backward.\\n* Adjust the front leveling legs if needed, raising them slightly so the freezer leans toward the back wall.\\n* Ensure the floor beneath the freezer is even and stable.\\n\\n![frigidaire-freezer-defrost-drain-pan-image](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/2dgEDUMZyD0XHgp9xF0vRc/bbcc9c33b06911fd8a1ad9503424ce8c/frigidaire-freezer-defrost-drain-pan-part-image.png)\\n\\n## Defrost Drain Pan Issues\\n\\nThe drain pan at the bottom of the freezer collects water from the defrost cycle, where it evaporates naturally. \\n\\nIf the pan is cracked or overflowing due to high humidity, water may leak onto the floor.\\n\\n### How to Fix It:\\n\\n* Unplug the refrigerator. Access the drain pan and check for cracks. If damaged, replace it.\\n* If excessive water is collecting in the drain pan, check the door gasket and door alignment for problems that can cause excessive moisture to enter the freezer and cause the overflow of the drain pan. Also, check if the defrost cycle is running too often (which can be caused by a faulty defrost timer or thermostat).\\n* Clear any foreign objects from the drain pan and clean the pan with warm, soapy water to prevent mold growth.\\n* Check the condenser fan to make sure it’s working properly to help evaporate water out of the drain pan between defrost cycles.\\n\\n## Excess Frost Buildup from Overloading\\n\\nOverstuffing your freezer can block air vents, leading to uneven cooling and excessive frost accumulation. This extra frost will eventually melt during defrost cycles, creating more water than the drain system can handle.\\n\\n### How to Fix It:\\n\\n* Keep items organized to ensure air can circulate properly.\\n* Avoid pushing food against the back wall where the air vents are located.\\n* If excessive frost has built up, manually defrost the freezer by unplugging it and letting it thaw completely before turning it back on.\\n\\n## Preventing Future Freezer Leaks\\n\\nOnce you’ve identified and fixed the leak, take steps to prevent future issues:\\n\\n* Keep the freezer door closed as much as possible to reduce moisture buildup.\\n* Inspect and clean the defrost drain if necessary every few months.\\n* Ensure proper leveling so water drains correctly.\\n* Don’t overfill the freezer—leave space for air circulation.\\n\\nA leaking freezer isn’t something you want to ignore. Left unchecked, it can lead to expensive repairs and potential water damage. By addressing these common causes, you can keep your freezer running efficiently and your floors dry.\\n\\nIf you’ve gone through these troubleshooting steps and your freezer is still leaking, it might be time to schedule [freezer repair](/repair/freezer-repair-service) to have a professional technician visit your home and fix the leaking problem.\\n\\nProfessional [freezer maintenance](/maintain) can also help keep your appliance in top shape and help prevent future leaks.\\n\\nGot a leaking freezer?

        "content": "self.__next_f.push([1,\"## How Chest Freezers Work: The Basics\\n\\nAt the core of a chest freezer’s operation lies a simple refrigeration process. Here’s how it works step-by-step:\\n\\n### The Compressor Starts the Cycle\\n\\nThe compressor pumps refrigerant gas through the system. The compressor pressurizes the refrigerant gas, which raises the refrigerant’s temperature.\\n\\n### Condenser Coils Cool the Refrigerant\\n\\nThe hot, pressurized refrigerant moves through condenser coils on the outside of the freezer or inside the chest freezer cabinet walls – depending on your model. \\n\\nAs the refrigerant cools down in the condenser coils, it turns into a high-pressure liquid.\\n\\n### The Evaporator Absorbs Heat\\n\\nThe liquid refrigerant passes through a capillary tube or expansion valve to lower the liquid refrigerant’s pressure and spray the refrigerant liquid into the evaporator.  \\n\\nInside the freezer compartment, the low pressure refrigerant liquid absorbs heat as it evaporates back into a gas. This cools down the freezer interior below freezing.\\n\\nThe evaporator inside the chest freezer is refrigerant tubing that runs through the inside walls of the freezer just inside the freezer compartment liner.\\n\\n### The Cold Control Thermostat Maintains Cold Temperatures\\n\\nA thermostat monitors the internal temperature and cycles the compressor on and off to maintain freezer temperature around 0 degrees or lower depending on the thermostat setting that you choose.\\n\\nChest freezers rely on insulation and a sealed lid to maintain low temperatures. This design minimizes energy use and keeps food frozen even during brief power outages.\\n\\n## How to Defrost a Chest Freezer\\n\\nOver time, frost can build up inside your chest freezer, reducing efficiency and storage space. Defrosting your freezer restores its performance. \\n\\nWhen your freezer has 1/4 to 1/2 inch of frost lining the inside walls, it's time to defrost.\\n\\nHere’s how to do it:\\n\\n### Store Your Food\\n\\nStart by moving the frozen food to ice chests to keep it cold and then unplug the freezer.\\n\\n![inserting-a-drain-tube-into-a-chest-freezer-defrost-drain](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/1j4C86KevFL0q88eNyBIHI/d089be3b9115d1b865dbe422271580c0/installing-a-defrost-drain-tube-on-a-chest-freezer.png)\\n\\n### Prepare the External Drain\\n\\nFollow these steps to deal with water that will drain out of the freezer during the defrost process:\\n\\n1. Locate the exterior defrost drain plug and remove it.\\n2. Place a shallow drain pan under the exterior drain plug or connect a ½-inch drain tube to the drain. You can also use a ½-inch garden hose adapter to connect a garden hose to freezer drain. Route the drain tube or garden hose to a floor drain or the outside of your home.\\n\\nIf you use a drain pan to collect water, you’ll need to monitor the water level in the pan and empty it during the defrost process to prevent it from overflowing.\\n\\n![removing-the-internal-defrost-drain-plug-on-a-chest-freezer](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/6YRWfl2ntUTOU8dPdkRqVc/eb652c8a8a769d7039b7735f8b8303ce/removing-the-chest-freezer-interior-defrost-drain-plug.png)\\n\\n### Remove the Internal Defrost Drain Plug\\n\\nPull out the internal defrost drain plug from the bottom of the freezer compartment so water will drain out of the cabinet during defrosting.\\n\\n### Defrost the Freezer\\n\\n* Leave the freezer lid open and allow frost to melt off the freezer walls and floor.\\n* To speed up the defrost process, use a spray bottle to spray water on the frost so it melts faster.\\n* As the ice and frost softens, use a plastic scraper to gently remove chunks of frost and ice. Avoid metal tools, which can damage the interior.\\n* When all of the frost is melted off and removed from the walls and floor of the freezer, wipe out remaining water on the freezer floor with dry towels. \\n* Reinstall the interior defrost drain plug.\\n* Wipe down the interior of the freezer with a solution of warm water and mild detergent. \\n* Wipe down the interior surfaces with plain water to remove detergent residue.\\n* Dry the freezer interior completely to prevent new ice from forming quickly.\\n* Remove the drain pan or drain hose from the exterior drain and reinstall the exterior drain plug.\\n\\n### Restock and Restart the Freezer\\n\\nPlug the freezer back in and make sure it starts cooling.\\n\\nRestock the food and monitor the freezer to make sure that it maintains the right temperature.\\n\\nIf the freezer doesn’t cool properly, schedule [freezer repair](/repair/freezer-repair-service) service and we’ll send a technician to your home to fix the problem.\\n\\n## Chest Freezer Maintenance Tips\\n\\nA little regular maintenance goes a long way in extending the life of your chest freezer. Follow these tips to keep it running smoothly:\\n\\n### Check the Lid Seal\\nInspect the gasket around the lid regularly. If the seal appears cracked or loose, replace it to prevent cold air leaks.\\n\\n### Clean the Condenser Coils\\n\\nIf your chest freezer has exposed condenser coils, dust or vacuum the condenser coils at least twice a year. Clean coils improve efficiency and reduce energy costs.\\n\\n### Organize the Interior\\n\\nUse bins or baskets to group similar items together. This makes it easier to find what you need and reduces how long the lid stays open.\\n\\n### Set the Right Temperature\\n\\nKeep your freezer at 0°F (-18°C) for optimal performance. Use a freezer thermometer for accuracy.\\n\\n### Keep it Level\\n\\nEnsure the freezer sits on a level surface. An uneven freezer can cause compressor issues over time.\\n\\n### Schedule Professional Maintenance \\n\\nAnnual professional [freezer maintenance](/maintain) will keep your appliance in top shape and running smoothly. Our technician will visit your home and check all parts of your freezer including the wiring, condenser coils, lid gasket and cold control thermostat. \\n\\nThe tech will recommend any repairs needed and make adjustments necessary to keep your freezer in top shape and operating properly.\\n\\nProfessional freezer maintenance is especially beneficial if you’re storing a large amount of meat or produce in your freezer that you can’t afford to lose because of an unexpected freezer failure.\\n\\n## Troubleshooting Common Chest Freezer Problems\\n\\nChest freezers are reliable, but they can encounter problems. Here are common issues and how to address them:\\n\\n### Freezer Not Cooling\\n\\nFollow these troubleshooting tips to resolve a problem with the freezer not cooling:\\n\\n#### Check the Power\\n\\n* Make sure that the power cord is securely plugged into the electrical outlet.\\n* Check the electrical outlet for power by plugging in a night light or similar small electrical item. \\n* If the electrical outlet isn’t working, reset the house circuit breaker for the freezer’s electrical outlet.\\n* If the outlet still doesn’t work, have an electrician fix the electrical outlet.\\n\\n#### Inspect the Cold Control Thermostat\\n\\nAdjust the thermostat and listen for the compressor to start.\\n\\nIf the compressor doesn’t start, __unplug the freezer power cord__ and check the wiring connections on the cold control thermostat.\\n\\nReconnect any loose wires and repair any broken wires. Here’s a video that shows how to repair wires:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CGvOheMLsrA\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nIf you’re not confident that you can safely repair damaged wiring on your own, schedule [freezer repair](/repair/freezer-repair-service) service and we’ll send a Sears Home Services technician to your home to fix the wires for you.\\n\\n#### Clean the Condenser Coils\\n\\nDirty condenser coils will prevent refrigerant from cooling properly during the cooling cycle and the freezer won’t be able to maintain the set temperature. \\n\\nWhen you have a freezer with exposed condenser coils, clean dust and dirt off the coils if they’re dirty.\\n\\n### Excessive Frost Buildup\\n\\nFrost buildup in a chest freezer is typically caused by a damaged or loose lid gasket. \\n\\nInspect the lid gasket and adjust it if needed so it seals properly.\\n\\nReplace a damaged gasket to prevent moisture from entering the chest freezer.\\n\\n## Unusual Noises\\n\\nKnocking noises coming from the compressor typically indicate an internal compressor failure. This type of problem will almost always need to be addressed and repaired by a service technician.\\n\\nIf you hear the compressor try to start followed by a clicking noise, the compressor may be locked up and need replacing or a bad start relay on the compressor is preventing the motor from starting.\\n\\nIf you’re suspect that the freezer has a bad start relay and you’re confident in your DIY skill, you can __unplug the freezer__ and replace the start relay by carefully following the steps in this illustrated repair guide:\\n\\n[How to replace a freezer compressor start relay](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/repair-guide/how-to-replace-a-freezer-compressor-start-relay)\\n\\nOf course, if you’re not confident that you can find a fix the noise problem in your freezer on your own, schedule freezer repair services and we’ll send a technician to your home to fix the problem for you.\\n\\nChest freezers are straightforward appliances, but they require regular care to perform at their best. \\n\\nBy understanding how they work, defrosting them properly, maintaining their components, and addressing common issues, you can ensure your freezer runs efficiently for years.\\n\"])",

But how exactly do chest freezers work, and how can you keep them running efficiently? Let’s find out.\\\\n\\\",\\\"keyTakeaway1\\\":\\\"Chest freezers use a refrigeration cycle where the compressor pressurizes refrigerant, which then moves through condenser coils to cool down, and finally into the evaporator, where it absorbs heat to keep the freezer's interior below freezing. A thermostat regulates the temperature, while insulation and a sealed lid maintain energy efficiency.\\\",\\\"keyTakeaway2\\\":\\\"Regular defrosting is crucial to maintain efficiency. Steps include unplugging the freezer, draining melted frost, manually removing ice with a plastic scraper, cleaning and drying the interior, and restoring the drain plugs before restarting and restocking the freezer.\\\",\\\"keyTakeaway3\\\":\\\"Routine care like cleaning condenser coils, checking the lid seal, organizing the interior, and ensuring the freezer sits on a level surface can extend its lifespan.

Sears Home Services notes they’re usually more energy-efficient and offer more capacity per dollar.\\\",\\\"faqQuestion2\\\":\\\"Is defrosting harder with a chest freezer?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer2\\\":\\\"They’re often manual-defrost, so you must periodically remove frost. Sears Home Services can advise on a safe process or recommend an upgrade if defrosting becomes too frequent.\\\",\\\"faqQuestion3\\\":\\\"Are chest freezers prone to leaks?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer3\\\":\\\"Leaks occur if the drain plug or liner cracks. Sears Home Services checks for damages and repairs or seals them properly.\\\",\\\"faqQuestion4\\\":\\\"Do they cost less to run?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer4\\\":\\\"Typically, yes—cold air stays inside when you open the lid.
