Whether you have an over-the-range microwave that won’t heat or a built-in model with an unresponsive control panel, the appliance repair experts at Sears Home Services are here to help.\nOur certified technicians service all major brands including GE, Whirlpool, Kenmore, Frigidaire, Panasonic, and more. From fixing door latches and replacing magnetrons to diagnosing turntable and keypad problems, we provide fast, reliable, in-home appliance repairs backed by years of expertise.\nWe understand that a microwave is a daily essential. That’s why we offer:\n\nComprehensive repair services for over-the-range and built-in microwave models\nExpert diagnostics to determine the root cause of failures\nGenuine manufacturer parts whenever possible for long-lasting results\nService across the U.S. with convenient appointment scheduling online or by phone\n\nDon’t put up with a microwave that isn’t working right. Schedule your microwave repair service with Sears Home Services today and get your kitchen running smoothly again.\nCommon Microwave Problems We Repair\nMicrowave runs but won’t heat food\nIf your microwave powers on, the light turns on, and the turntable spins—but your food stays cold—you’re not alone. This is one of the most common microwave repair problems, especially with over-the-range and built-in units.\nSeveral components are responsible for generating the heat inside your microwave. When one fails, the unit may appear to operate normally but won’t actually cook your food. Common causes include:\n\nMagnetron failure – The magnetron produces the microwave energy that heats food. If it burns out, the appliance will run but not heat.\nDefective high-voltage diode or capacitor – These parts work with the magnetron to create energy. If one fails, you’ll often hear humming or buzzing while food remains cold.\nBlown internal fuse or faulty control board – Sometimes the issue is electronic. A failed control board may send power to the fan and turntable but not to the heating system.\n\nYou’ll need to schedule appliance repair service to fix these types of microwave failures.\nControl panel not responding or showing error codes\nWhen the control panel is dead or isn’t responding, the main electronic control board or the control panel component itself could be defective. A wiring failure could also prevent the control panel from working.\nWhen you’re seeing an error code on your microwave, look up the code in the owner’s manual for possible solutions. If you’re not able to resolve the problem and clear the microwave error code yourself, you’ll need to schedule repair service.\nTurntable not spinning\nCheck the turntable setting to make sure rotation is enabled. Adjust the turntable alignment if the coupling rotates but the glass tray doesn’t spin.\nIf the coupling doesn’t rotate, pull it off and check for damage. Replace the coupling if it’s worn or damaged.\nIf the coupling motor shaft doesn’t rotate, the turntable motor may be bad.\nIf you’re unable to find and fix the cause of the turntable not spinning, have a technician diagnose the failure and repair the microwave.\nLoud buzzing or unusual noises\nLoud buzzing noise in a microwave is often caused by a bad magnetron, defective diode, or malfunctioning cooling fan. Clunking or rattling noise can be caused by problems with the turntable such as a worn coupler or damaged roller guide.\nDoor not latching or staying closed\nDamaged door hooks or catches can prevent the door from latching properly or staying closed. It’s best to have a microwave technician examine the door components and correct this type of failure.\nArc marks and burnt spots inside the microwave cavity\nSome of the common causes of arc marks and burnt spots inside your microwave are food spattered on the liner that is not cleaned off, incorrect rack usage during cooking and aluminum foil or metal getting too close to the side during cooking.\nFor microwaves that are not stainless steel on the inside, you can repair arc marks up to the size of a quarter using this touch-up paint, but only if the marks appear on the inside walls, the floor, or the ceiling. If you’re confident in your DIY repair abilities, follow the steps in this video to repair arc or burn marks inside the microwave cavity:\n\nIf you’re not confident that you can repair the microwave on your own, schedule repair service.\nOur technicians have the training and tools to diagnose these issues quickly and restore your appliance.",

This is one of the most common microwave repair problems, especially with over-the-range and built-in units.\nSeveral components are responsible for generating the heat inside your microwave. When one fails, the unit may appear to operate normally but won’t actually cook your food. Common causes include:\n\nMagnetron failure – The magnetron produces the microwave energy that heats food. If it burns out, the appliance will run but not heat.\nDefective high-voltage diode or capacitor – These parts work with the magnetron to create energy. If one fails, you’ll often hear humming or buzzing while food remains cold.\nBlown internal fuse or faulty control board – Sometimes the issue is electronic. A failed control board may send power to the fan and turntable but not to the heating system.\n\nYou’ll need to schedule appliance repair service to fix these types of microwave failures.\nControl panel not responding or showing error codes\nWhen the control panel is dead or isn’t responding, the main electronic control board or the control panel component itself could be defective. A wiring failure could also prevent the control panel from working.\nWhen you’re seeing an error code on your microwave, look up the code in the owner’s manual for possible solutions. If you’re not able to resolve the problem and clear the microwave error code yourself, you’ll need to schedule repair service.\nTurntable not spinning\nCheck the turntable setting to make sure rotation is enabled. Adjust the turntable alignment if the coupling rotates but the glass tray doesn’t spin.\nIf the coupling doesn’t rotate, pull it off and check for damage. Replace the coupling if it’s worn or damaged.\nIf the coupling motor shaft doesn’t rotate, the turntable motor may be bad.\nIf you’re unable to find and fix the cause of the turntable not spinning, have a technician diagnose the failure and repair the microwave.\nLoud buzzing or unusual noises\nLoud buzzing noise in a microwave is often caused by a bad magnetron, defective diode, or malfunctioning cooling fan. Clunking or rattling noise can be caused by problems with the turntable such as a worn coupler or damaged roller guide.\nDoor not latching or staying closed\nDamaged door hooks or catches can prevent the door from latching properly or staying closed. It’s best to have a microwave technician examine the door components and correct this type of failure.\nArc marks and burnt spots inside the microwave cavity\nSome of the common causes of arc marks and burnt spots inside your microwave are food spattered on the liner that is not cleaned off, incorrect rack usage during cooking and aluminum foil or metal getting too close to the side during cooking.\nFor microwaves that are not stainless steel on the inside, you can repair arc marks up to the size of a quarter using this touch-up paint, but only if the marks appear on the inside walls, the floor, or the ceiling. If you’re confident in your DIY repair abilities, follow the steps in this video to repair arc or burn marks inside the microwave cavity:\n\nIf you’re not confident that you can repair the microwave on your own, schedule repair service.\nOur technicians have the training and tools to diagnose these issues quickly and restore your appliance.",
