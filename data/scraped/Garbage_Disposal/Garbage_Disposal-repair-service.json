Our expert technicians bring decades of experience directly to your kitchen, quickly restoring this essential appliance to full functionality.\nWe understand both the mechanical complexity of garbage disposals and the urgency you feel when problems arise. Our factory-trained technicians bring specialized expertise to diagnose and repair every type of garbage disposal failure.\nCommon Garbage Disposal Issues We Fix\nThrough the years, we've noticed these common garbage disposal failures.\nUnit Not Turning On\nWhen your garbage disposal is completely dead, try these DIY fixes to get it going again:\n\n\nCheck That the Garbage Disposal is Plugged In: Ensure the disposal is plugged in securely. Many disposals plug into an outlet beneath the sink.\n\n\nReset the Garbage Disposal Overload Switch: Locate the reset button, typically a small red button on the bottom of the unit. Press it to reset the motor.\n\n\nTest the Electrical Outlet: Check to see if the electrical outlet is working by plugging a night light or other item into the outlet.\n\n\nReset the House Circuit Breaker: If the outlet is dead, reset the house circuit breaker. If the outlet still doesn’t work after resetting the breaker, have an electrician fix the electrical outlet.\n\n\nCheck the Power Cord: If the outlet works, unplug the garbage disposal and check the power cord wiring. Reconnect any loose power cord wires or replace the power cord if it’s damage.\n\n\nIf these troubleshooting tips don’t help, then an internal wiring failure or a bad motor could be preventing the garbage disposal from working.\nSchedule appliance repair service to have a service technician fix the problem.\nUnusual Noises\nA humming sound indicates the motor is getting electrical power but the impellers aren’t spinning. This often happens when something jams the mechanism.\nFollow these steps to free up jammed impellers:\n\nUnplug the garbage disposal power cord.\nInsert an Allen wrench into the hex-shaped hole on the bottom of the disposal unit and move it back and forth to dislodge the jammed item.\nUse tongs to lift the debris out of the hopper.\nPlug the garbage disposal back in.\n\nTest the garbage disposal to see if it works. If not, schedule service to have a Sears Home Services technician fix the problem.\nWater Leaks\nA leaking garbage disposal can damage your cabinet and flooring if not addressed quickly.\nIdentify the source of the leak and take the appropriate troubleshooting steps.\n\nTop Leak: Check the sink flange and tighten the mounting bolts. Replace an leaking parts.\nSide Leak: Inspect the dishwasher or drain pipe connections and tighten or replace pipes and/or gaskets.\nBottom Leak: A bottom leak often indicates a cracked disposal unit that needs replacement.\n\nIf you're unable to find and resolve the source of the garbage disposal leak, schedule appliance repair and we'll send out a technician to fix the leak for you.\nWhy Choose Sears Home Services?\nWhat makes Sears Home Services different?\n\nCertified Technicians: It starts with experience—over 50 years of it.

Instead, schedule a professional repair service to safely identify and clear the obstruction.How can I tell if my garbage disposal needs to be replaced?While minor issues like jams or leaks can usually be repaired, if your disposal is making persistent strange noises, leaking from multiple spots, or frequently malfunctioning, it may be time to consider replacement.\nA professional technician will assess the overall condition of the unit, taking into account its age, performance, and repair history, to determine whether repair or replacement is the best option for you.What should I do if my garbage disposal is leaking water?If your garbage disposal is leaking water, it’s important to act quickly to prevent damage to your cabinetry and flooring.\nLeaks from the top of the disposal typically indicate a problem with the sink flange seal, while leaks from the bottom could suggest internal seal failure or a crack in the unit.\nA professional technician can properly diagnose the cause and provide an effective solution.Can I attempt to repair my garbage disposal myself, or should I call a professional?While some minor issues, like resetting a tripped circuit or clearing a simple jam with a hex wrench, can be handled by homeowners, most garbage disposal problems require professional attention.\nDisposals involve a combination of electricity, water, and sharp blades, making them dangerous for DIY repairs.\nA professional technician has the right tools, experience, and knowledge to safely and accurately address the issue, ensuring a long-lasting fix.",
