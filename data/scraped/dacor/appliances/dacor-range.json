If a surface burner works, then you know that your oven should be getting gas as well.\\n* If the surface burner doesn’t work, check the gas supply cut-off valve for your stove to make sure that it's open. \\n* If you’re troubleshooting a wall oven, check to see if the broil burner gets gas and heats up (if your wall oven has a separate broil burner). If you have a double oven, you can check to see if the 2nd oven is heating. If other burners in a wall oven are heating, then you know that the inoperative oven burner should be getting gas as well.\\n* If no burners in your wall oven are heating, check the gas supply cut-off valve for the oven to make sure that it’s open.\\n* If gas supply valve for your stove or wall oven is open and you’re not getting gas to the appliance, check other gas appliances in your home such as the gas dryer. If your entire home is without gas, check the main gas cut-off valve for your house. Open the main cut-off valve if it’s shut. This may restore gas to your oven and other appliances so they work properly.\\n\\nIf the main gas cut-off valve for your home is open and no appliances are getting gas, then you need to contact your gas supplier to figure out what’s wrong.\\n\\nIf other appliances are getting gas but you suspect that your wall oven or stove isn’t getting gas, then you’ll likely need to have a plumber or gas technician from your gas supplier fix the gas supply going to your stove or wall oven.\\n\\n### Check the Service Cut-Off Valve\\n\\nMany gas ranges have a service cut-off valve on their pressure regulator at the back of the stove. It shuts off the gas supply to the oven but not the surface burners. \\n\\nIf the surface burners on your gas stove work but the oven burners aren’t getting gas, make sure that the lever on the service cut-off valve is in the open position.\\n\\n![Checking the service cut-off valve](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/3sUOqIPGTYVRNvsIYQHlov/4b8cffc6edcafbfed88dfb940a91afd0/Check_the_service_cut-off_valve.png)\\n\\n## Advanced Troubleshooting For a Gas Oven That Won’t Heat\\n\\nWhen the basic troubleshooting steps don’t do the trick, you’ll need to conduct some advanced troubleshooting to fix a gas oven that isn’t heating. Nothing’s better than a YouTube video to describe advanced troubleshooting for a non-heating gas oven. Follow the steps in this Sears PartsDirect YouTube video to fix your gas oven:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iuRrcw6y7Dc\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nAfter the video goes through some of the basic troubleshooting steps described above, the following diagnostic techniques are used to figure out what’s wrong with a gas oven that won’t heat.\\n\\n### Test the Oven Igniter\\n\\nMost gas ovens use a glow bar ignition system that uses this ignition process:\\n\\n1. The control sends electrical current through the igniter and safety gas valve to light the oven burner and heat the oven.\\n2. The igniter heats up but the safety gas valve won't open to ignite the burner until the igniter reaches a safe ignition temperature.\\n3. As the igniter heats up, the resistance of the igniter element decreases and more current flows through the circuit to the safety gas valve.\\n4. When the igniter reaches ignition temperature, its resistance is low enough to allow enough current to flow through the circuit and open the safety gas valve.\\n5. Gas flows through the open valve and to the burner and ignites.\\n\\nThe number 1 failure preventing a gas oven from heating is a weak igniter. The igniter won’t get hot enough to allow adequate current to flow to the safety valve so the valve won’t open to let gas flow to the burner for ignition.\\n\\nThat’s why we recommend testing the oven igniter first.\\n\\nPull the bottom panel out of your cold oven. Start the oven and see if the igniter glows.\\n\\nIf the igniter glows but the burner doesn’t ignite because the gas valve doesn’t open, then you’ll likely need to replace the igniter. As noted in the video, if you're uncertain whether your glowing igniter has failed, you can [schedule service for your oven](/repair/oven-repair-service) and have a Sears service technician check the amp draw through the igniter circuit.\\n\\nIf you’re convinced that the oven igniter is bad, then you can [order a new igniter](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/category/1234574/range-parts) and replace the igniter. Replacing a gas oven igniter is a relatively safe repair that most DIY’ers can accomplish on their own because it doesn’t involve disconnecting any gas lines in the oven. Follow the steps in this YouTube video to replace the oven igniter:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DTXwfTiFZfE\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nNow, if the igniter __doesn’t__ glow, then the igniter element may be broken. You’ll need a [multimeter](https://www.sears.com/craftsman-multimeter-digital-with-8-functions-and-20/p-03482141000P) to check resistance through the igniter so see if the element is bad.\\n\\nUnplug the range. For safety, always disconnect power before checking resistance. To check the resistance of the igniter, put the meter leads on the igniter terminals. If you measure between 10 and 2,500 ohms, then you know your igniter is okay.\\n\\nIf the igniter measures no continuity, then you need to replace the igniter.\\n\\n## Test the Safety Gas Valve\\n\\nNext, check resistance through the safety gas valve. The meter should measure less than 5 ohms of resistance through the terminals on the safety gas valve. \\n\\nIf the safety gas valve measures no continuity, you can [have a Sears technician replace that part](/repair/range-repair-service). Replacing the safety gas valve involve disconnection of gas lines inside the oven.\\n\\n## Check the Wiring and Control Board\\n\\nWhen you find that the igniter and safety gas valve appear to be okay, you’ll need to check wiring in the ignition circuit and the electronic oven control board. \\n\\nWith electrical power still disconnected from the oven, access the back of the electronic oven control board and check resistance through the ignition circuit wires connected to the electronic control board. \\n\\nIf you measure the same resistance through the ignition circuit as you measured through the igniter (between 10 and 2,500 ohms), then replace the electronic control board because you know that the wiring through the ignition circuit is okay.\\n\\nIf you measure infinite resistance (also called an open load) through the ignition circuit wiring, then you'll need to trace the wires through the ignition circuit and repair the broken wire (with the oven still disconnected from electrical power).\\n\\nThese DIY troubleshooting steps should help you fix a gas oven that isn’t heating in most situations. If you can’t figure out what’s wrong and fix the oven on your own, don’t hesitate to [schedule oven repair service](/repair/oven-repair-service) and we’ll send a Sears Tech right out to your home to fix the oven.\"])",

Here’s a DIY repair video that shows how to diagnose and fix a problem with a coil surface element not heating.\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eLZcldj0J3k\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Sears Home Services Can Replace a Burnt Out Stove Element When You Have a Glass Top Range\\n\\nWhen your stove has a ceramic glass top, schedule [range repair near you](/repair/range-repair-service) with a Sears Home Services Technician to replace the burnt out stove element. Our technicians are factory trained on most major brands and are qualified for [LG stove repair](/repair/lg/range), [Maytag stove repair](/repair/maytag/range), [Whirlpool range repair](/repair/whirlpool/range), and more. Safely lifting the glass top and replacing a radiant surface element is a challenge for most appliance repair DIY’ers. \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Keep Your Stove in Top Shape With Annual Professional Maintenance by Sears Home Services\\n\\nDepend on Sears Home Services to help you keep your stove in top shape with by [scheduling annual stove maintenance checks](/maintain). Our technician will perform the following services during the visit:\\n\\n* __Check control operation.__  Range controls are checked for accurate temperature control of the oven and stovetop burners. Faulty controls can cause the range to waste energy when overheating occurs.\\n* __Examine oven door alignment and clean the oven door gasket.__ A loose door gasket or bent door hinges can prevent the oven door from sealing, allowing heat to escape during baking. You’ll wind up paying higher energy bills because the burner ignites more often and stays burning longer to heat the oven. The technician adjusts and cleans the oven door gasket to make sure it seals the oven door properly.\\n* __Test oven self-cleaning operation.__ On ranges that have self-cleaning ovens, the service technician checks the control and oven door lock to make sure it stays closed during the self-cleaning cycle. During the self-cleaning operation, oven heats to extremely high temperatures to burn spills and residue inside the oven to ash. To prevent fires, the oven door must remain closed and locked during self-cleaning. If you were to open the door during self-cleaning, a sudden rush of air into the extremely hot oven can cause a serious fire. \\n* __Check and clean the stovetop burners.__ The technician cleans and checks electric elements to make sure they’re operating properly and safely. A short circuit in an electric stovetop burner can cause a serious electrocution risk. An element on a glass-top range that overheats can damage the glass top. On a gas range, the technician cleans checks and adjusts the surface burners. A dirty surface burner can fail to ignite – posing a serious safety risk. \\n* __Check oven burners or elements.__ The technician examines and adjusts oven burners in a gas range or electric elements in an electric range. Gas oven burners that aren’t adjusted correctly can fail to heat the oven properly and may emit excessive carbon monoxide. Electric elements that aren’t heating correctly will fail to heat the oven properly. A shorted electric element also can pose a serious electrocution risk.\\n* __Inspect readily accessible electrical wiring.__ The technician will check the wiring on gas and electric ranges, for insulation damage, proper grounding and secure connections. Damaged wiring or wiring that’s not secure can cause an electrocution risk. The ground connection dissipates an electrical short to prevent you from getting an electric shock if a loose wire touches metal in the range. \\n* __Level the range and check the anti-tip device.__ The technician levels the range to reduce the risk that a pot or pan will accidentally slide off a gas surface burner. Leveling also helps items bake properly in the oven. The anti-tip device is an essential bracket that prevents the range from tipping forward when you open the oven door and extend an oven rack out of the range with a dish on the rack.\\n\\nHaving your stove professionally cleaned and maintained every year will help keep it operating efficiently and lasting longer.\\n\\nWe can keep all of your home appliances in top shape when you [schedule our Kitchen \\u0026 Laundry Appliance Check-Up](/maintain/kitchen-laundry-appliance-check-up).

When ignited, the gas produces a flame that heats cookware directly. This direct heat offers unmatched control, allowing you to make quick adjustments to temperature, which is why gas stoves are often preferred in many kitchens.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How Does a Gas Stove Work?\\n\\nA gas stove connects to your home’s gas supply through a gas line with a shut-off valve. The incoming gas supply then connects to a pressure regulator that limits gas pressure and flow to design specifications for your stove.\\n\\nFrom the pressure regulator, the gas supply branches out to the cooktop burners and the oven burners. Here are descriptions of those stove systems.\\n\\n### Cooktop Burner System\\n\\nHere’s how the cooktop burner system works in a gas stove:\\n\\n* Gas from the pressure regulator first goes to the cooktop burner control valves. \\n* When you turn on a cooktop burner, gas travels from the control valve to the burner head. \\n* The control valve has an igniter switch that sends current to the spark igniter electrode next to the burner head to ignite the gas when you turn on a cooktop burner. The burner ignites and begins heating.\\n* You can adjust the cooktop burner flame by rotating the burner control valve.\\n* When you’ve finished cooking on the burner, you can shut off the control valve and the burner flame will go out.\\n\\n### How a Gas Oven Works\\n\\n* When you set your desired temperature and turn the control knob on, the thermostat sends electric current to the glow bar igniter to start the oven. If you have an oven with an electronic control panel, the electronic control board will activate a relay and send current to the glow bar ignition system to light the burner.\\n* The igniter heats up and glows to ignite the burner when the safety gas valve opens. For safety, the gas valve in the ignition system won’t open until the glow bar gets hot enough to ignite the gas and allows enough electrical current to flow downstream to the current-activated switch on that device.\\n* As the glow bar igniter heats up, its electrical resistance decreases to allow more current to flow to the safety gas valve. Once the igniter glow bar is so hot that it allows more than 3 amps of current to the safety gas valve switch, the bi-metal switch on the safety gas valve trips. This opens the gas valve and gas flows to the burner tube and ignites.\\n* The glow bar igniter continues to glow as the burner flames heat the oven. When the oven reaches the set temperature, the control shuts off current to the igniter and safety gas valve. The burner shuts off and stays off until oven temperature decreases about 10 degrees below the oven temperature set point. Then the ignition process repeats to light the burner and maintain the set temperature.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Benefits of Cooking with a Gas Stove\\n\\nThe oven and cooktop of a gas stove offer significant advantages over electric ranges.\\n\\n### Benefits of a Gas Stovetop\\n\\n* __Instant Heat:__ Flames appear immediately upon ignition. Fast heating burners save you time when cooking.\\n* __Precise Temperature Control:__ You can quickly increase or decrease surface burner heat by adjusting the knob. A gas burner provides consistent heating because it doesn’t cycle on and off like an electric surface element does when heating.\\n* __Even Heat Distribution:__ Flames wrap around cookware for uniform cooking.\\n* __Cost Efficiency:__ Natural gas and propane is often cheaper than electricity for powering stoves.\\n\\n### Advantages of a Gas Oven\\n\\n* __Quick Preheating:__ Gas ovens heat up faster than electric ovens because they generate heat directly from the flame.\\n* __Moist Baking Environment:__ The combustion process releases moisture, which can help prevent foods from drying out—ideal for baking and roasting.\\n* __Precise Temperature Control:__ Adjusting the oven temperature will result in quicker response in a gas oven. Also, the gas flame provides more immediate and precise heat level adjustments to consistently maintain baking temperature at the chosen setting.\\n* __Cost Efficiency:__ Natural gas and propane is often cheaper than electricity for heating the oven.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Tips for Safe and Efficient Gas Stove Use\\n\\nFollow these expert tips to use your gas stove safely.\\n\\n### Ensure Proper Ventilation\\n\\nGas stoves release combustion byproducts, so make sure your kitchen is well-ventilated. Run the range hood when using the gas stove.\\n\\nKeep the range hood running for a few minutes after you finish cooking or baking to exhaust all combustion fumes out of your kitchen.\\n\\n### Keep Burners Clean Regularly\\n\\nClogged burner nozzles can cause combustion problems and affect flame performance. Follow the procedure shown in this popular YouTube video to thoroughly clean stove top burners:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9m5nF-uvwkI\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n### Turn Off Burners Properly\\n\\nAlways double-check that burners are completely off after cooking.\\n\\n### Check for Leaks\\n\\nPeriodically inspect your gas supply line and connections. \\n\\nUse soapy water to detect leaks—bubbles will form where gas escapes from leaks or loose gas line connections.\\n\\nIf you ever smell gas, turn off the stove immediately, ventilate the area, and contact your local gas company.\\n\\n### Avoid Overcrowding the Oven\\n\\nOvercrowding the oven can block heat circulation, leading to air circulation problems in the oven cavity and uneven cooking.\\n\\nFollow the tips in this helpful YouTube video to position and use oven racks properly:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r_tcl5NCDjo\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n### Professional Maintenance\\n\\nSchedule professional [oven maintenance](/maintain) every year. A qualified service technician will visit your home and perform these essential oven maintenance, inspection and cleaning tasks:\\n\\n* Inspect gas supply connections.\\n* Check the ignition systems.\\n* Inspect surface and oven burners and clean them if needed.\\n* Examine cooktop and oven flames and adjust the flame settings if necessary.\\n* Check the overall cooktop and oven performance.\\n* Inspect readily accessible electrical wiring.\\n* Level the stove if necessary.\\n\\nAnnual professional maintenance won’t just ensure that the stove works safely and efficiently, it will also help your appliance last longer.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Common Gas Stove Problems and Solutions\\n\\n### Cooktop Issues\\n\\n* __Uneven Flame or Yellow Flame:__ Indicates improper gas-to-air ratio. Clean the burner and check for obstructions.\\n* __Burner Not Igniting:__ Check the ignition system and ensure the burner is clean and dry. A surface burner igniter switch and a spark module control the sparking for burners. A power supply problem, failed igniter switch, bad spark module or wiring failure in the spark ignition circuit can prevent the electrodes from sparking.\\n\\n### Gas Oven Problems\\n\\nFollow these expert troubleshooting tips when you encounter problems with your gas stove’s oven.\\n\\n#### Gas Oven Won’t Heat\\n\\nSeveral different problems can prevent the oven in your gas stove from heating. Follow the tips in this popular YouTube DIY video to fix an oven heating problem in your gas stove:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iuRrcw6y7Dc\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nIf you’re unable to find and fix the oven heating problem yourself, schedule [range repair](/repair/range-repair-service) service and we’ll send a Sears Home Services technician to your home to resolve the issue.\\n\\n#### Oven Temperature is Wrong\\n\\nIf the oven isn't heating to the baking temperature you set — it's too hot or not hot enough — the oven temperature sensor could be malfunctioning. Or the problem could be with the electronic oven control board, which controls oven functions.\\n\\nYou can test the oven temperature sensor probe by unplugging the range and measuring sensor probe resistance using a multimeter. It should measure about 1,080 ohms of resistance through most probes at room temperature.\\n\\nRefer to the tech sheet for the probe's resistance specification for your range. You can likely find the tech sheet in the control console or taped to the back of the range. Replace the oven temperature sensor probe if the multimeter doesn't measure the correct resistance through the probe. If the probe is okay, you might need to replace the electronic oven control board.\\n\\nIf you’re unable to find and fix the cause of this problem on your own, schedule [stove repair](/repair/range-repair-service) service and we’ll fix the issue for you.\\n\\n---\\n\\nGas stoves continue to be a favorite among home cooks. Their straightforward yet effective design combines practicality with precise performance, making them indispensable in kitchens across the country.\\n\\nWhether you’re simmering a delicate sauce or searing a steak, understanding how your gas stove works empowers you to make the most of this versatile appliance. Plus, with proper care and maintenance, your gas stove will serve you reliably for years to come.\\n\\nSears Home Services is standing by to help you with gas stove maintenance and repairs any time you need them.
