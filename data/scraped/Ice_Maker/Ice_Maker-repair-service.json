      "content": "Ice Maker Repair ServiceAt Sears Home Services, we specialize in comprehensive repair services for all types of freestanding ice makers and ice machines. Our certified technicians are equipped to handle a wide range of issues, ensuring your ice maker operates at peak performance.\nWe understand both the technical complexity of ice making systems and the urgency you feel when problems arise. Our factory-trained technicians bring specialized expertise to diagnose and repair every type of ice machine.\nCommon Ice Maker Issues We Fix\nIce Maker not Working\nWhen the ice maker has no power at all, there could be problems with the electrical outlet or circuit breaker. First, check the electrical outlet by plugging a small appliance into the outlet to see if it has power. If not, reset the house circuit breaker for the outlet. If it still doesn't have power, have an electrician repair the outlet. If the electrical outlet is okay, unplug the ice maker and check the power cord for damage. Replace the power cord if it's damaged.\nIf the ice maker will not run even though it has electrical power (the control panel powers up but the compressor and fans won't run), there could be a problem with the electronic control board, ice bin thermistor, evaporator thermistor or internal ice maker wiring.\nA power surge through the electrical lines may have disabled the electronic control board. Try resetting the electronic control board by unplugging the ice maker for one minute and then restoring power. If the ice maker doesn't run after restoring electrical power, you may need to replace the electronic control board.\nSome ice makers flash an error code on the control panel when the electronic control board detects a problem. Most ice makers won't operate when an error code flashes on the display. Refer to the owner’s manual for your ice maker to determine the cause of the error code when the control flashes control lights in a repeating pattern or displays a code on the digital display. Correct the cause of the error code and the ice maker should start working again.\nIf these troubleshooting tips don’t help, you’ll likely need to have a Sears Technician visit your home and repair the ice maker.\nNot Cutting the Ice Sheet Into Cubes\nWhen the cutter grid isn't heating up and cutting the ice slab into cubes, unplug the ice maker and check the wire harness connections between the cutter grid and the electronic control board. Reconnect loose wires and repair broken wires that you find.\nIf the wires are okay, a technician will likely need to replace the cutter grid if its wires don't heat when activated. If you replace the cutter grid and it still doesn't heat, then you'll likely need to replace the electronic control board because the board isn't sending voltage to the cutter grid.\nOf course, if these DIY repairs are beyond your expertise, schedule service to have a Sears Technician visit your home and repair the ice maker.\nIce Maker Leaks Water\nWhen you find water leaking from the ice maker:\n\nCheck for leaks in the house water supply line connected to the water inlet valve, the drain line and the drain pump. Repair any leak or replace the leaking part.\nUnplug the ice maker and check the water reservoir for a crack or hole. Replace the reservoir if it leaks.\nCheck the recirculation pump for leaks and replace it if leaking.\nCheck the ice bin for a crack and replace it if it leaks.\n\nIf you’re unable to find the cause of a leak or you’re unable to replace the leaking component yourself, schedule appliance repair service and a Sears Technician will visit your home and fix the ice maker.\nRuns but Won't Make Ice?\nWhen the ice maker runs but doesn't make any ice, a bad electronic control board, failed water supply, broken recirculation pump, sealed system failure or broken cutting grid could be causing the problem.\nA faulty electronic control board can prevent the ice maker from making any ice.\nA power surge through the electrical supply line to the ice maker can lock up the control board, so reset the control board by unplugging the ice maker for one minute, then restoring electrical power.\nIf the ice maker doesn't start making ice, check the evaporator plate. If the evaporator plate is dry and the water reservoir is full, then the recirculation pump is likely bad. If the reservoir is empty, check the water supply going to the ice maker. To check the water supply, unplug the ice maker and shut off the water supply cut-off valve. Disconnect the water supply line from the ice maker and place the end of the water supply line in a container. Briefly open the water supply cut-off valve and check for water flow from the end of the water supply line. If no water flows through the end of the supply line, have a plumber fix the water supply going to the ice maker. If water does flow through the supply line, you'll likely need to replace the water inlet valve because it's not opening to allow water to flow into the reservoir.\nIf the water reservoir and is full and water flows over the evaporator plate but doesn't freeze, then a failed condenser fan, bad compressor or lack of refrigerant could be preventing the evaporator plate from getting cold and freezing the water. Replace the condenser fan if it doesn't run when activated. If the condenser fan runs, you'll need to have a service technician diagnose and repair the sealed system, which includes the compressor and connecting tubes that carry refrigerant. The sealed system should only be repaired by a service technician because the repair involves the recovery and recharge of refrigerant, which is tightly regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\nIf you’re unable to diagnose and fix an ice maker problem yourself, schedule service and we’ll send a Sears Technician right out. Same-day and next-day service appointments are available in many areas.\nWhy Choose Sears for Ice Machine Repair?\nYou'll likely see lots of service providers when searching online for \"ice machine repair service near me.\" Choose Sears to repair your freestanding ice maker repair service because we have experienced technicians with the technical expertise and parts to fix any brand of ice maker – no matter where you bought it.\nWe use OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) parts to fix your ice maker. OEM parts fit properly according to manufacturer specifications and last longer than after-market repair parts.\nSears Technicians are factory-trained to repair the following brands of ice makers:\n\nKenmore\nWhirlpool\nKitchenAid\nGE (General Electric)\nEdgeStar\nDanby\n\nSears Technicians have access to technical documents and specifications needed to complete repairs on these and other under counter ice makers. Having access to the right parts and technical information ensures that Sears Techs can perform repairs on ice makers accurately and effectively.\nWhen looking for ice machine service near me, schedule service through us and we’ll have a technician visit your home to fix the problem soon.

First, check the electrical outlet by plugging a small appliance into the outlet to see if it has power. If not, reset the house circuit breaker for the outlet. If it still doesn't have power, have an electrician repair the outlet. If the electrical outlet is okay, unplug the ice maker and check the power cord for damage. Replace the power cord if it's damaged.\nIf the ice maker will not run even though it has electrical power (the control panel powers up but the compressor and fans won't run), there could be a problem with the electronic control board, ice bin thermistor, evaporator thermistor or internal ice maker wiring.\nA power surge through the electrical lines may have disabled the electronic control board. Try resetting the electronic control board by unplugging the ice maker for one minute and then restoring power. If the ice maker doesn't run after restoring electrical power, you may need to replace the electronic control board.\nSome ice makers flash an error code on the control panel when the electronic control board detects a problem. Most ice makers won't operate when an error code flashes on the display. Refer to the owner’s manual for your ice maker to determine the cause of the error code when the control flashes control lights in a repeating pattern or displays a code on the digital display. Correct the cause of the error code and the ice maker should start working again.\nIf these troubleshooting tips don’t help, you’ll likely need to have a Sears Technician visit your home and repair the ice maker.\nNot Cutting the Ice Sheet Into Cubes\nWhen the cutter grid isn't heating up and cutting the ice slab into cubes, unplug the ice maker and check the wire harness connections between the cutter grid and the electronic control board. Reconnect loose wires and repair broken wires that you find.\nIf the wires are okay, a technician will likely need to replace the cutter grid if its wires don't heat when activated. If you replace the cutter grid and it still doesn't heat, then you'll likely need to replace the electronic control board because the board isn't sending voltage to the cutter grid.\nOf course, if these DIY repairs are beyond your expertise, schedule service to have a Sears Technician visit your home and repair the ice maker.\nIce Maker Leaks Water\nWhen you find water leaking from the ice maker:\n\nCheck for leaks in the house water supply line connected to the water inlet valve, the drain line and the drain pump. Repair any leak or replace the leaking part.\nUnplug the ice maker and check the water reservoir for a crack or hole. Replace the reservoir if it leaks.\nCheck the recirculation pump for leaks and replace it if leaking.\nCheck the ice bin for a crack and replace it if it leaks.\n\nIf you’re unable to find the cause of a leak or you’re unable to replace the leaking component yourself, schedule appliance repair service and a Sears Technician will visit your home and fix the ice maker.\nRuns but Won't Make Ice?\nWhen the ice maker runs but doesn't make any ice, a bad electronic control board, failed water supply, broken recirculation pump, sealed system failure or broken cutting grid could be causing the problem.\nA faulty electronic control board can prevent the ice maker from making any ice.\nA power surge through the electrical supply line to the ice maker can lock up the control board, so reset the control board by unplugging the ice maker for one minute, then restoring electrical power.\nIf the ice maker doesn't start making ice, check the evaporator plate. If the evaporator plate is dry and the water reservoir is full, then the recirculation pump is likely bad. If the reservoir is empty, check the water supply going to the ice maker. To check the water supply, unplug the ice maker and shut off the water supply cut-off valve. Disconnect the water supply line from the ice maker and place the end of the water supply line in a container. Briefly open the water supply cut-off valve and check for water flow from the end of the water supply line. If no water flows through the end of the supply line, have a plumber fix the water supply going to the ice maker. If water does flow through the supply line, you'll likely need to replace the water inlet valve because it's not opening to allow water to flow into the reservoir.\nIf the water reservoir and is full and water flows over the evaporator plate but doesn't freeze, then a failed condenser fan, bad compressor or lack of refrigerant could be preventing the evaporator plate from getting cold and freezing the water. Replace the condenser fan if it doesn't run when activated. If the condenser fan runs, you'll need to have a service technician diagnose and repair the sealed system, which includes the compressor and connecting tubes that carry refrigerant. The sealed system should only be repaired by a service technician because the repair involves the recovery and recharge of refrigerant, which is tightly regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\nIf you’re unable to diagnose and fix an ice maker problem yourself, schedule service and we’ll send a Sears Technician right out. Same-day and next-day service appointments are available in many areas.\nWhy Choose Sears for Ice Machine Repair?\nYou'll likely see lots of service providers when searching online for \"ice machine repair service near me.\" Choose Sears to repair your freestanding ice maker repair service because we have experienced technicians with the technical expertise and parts to fix any brand of ice maker – no matter where you bought it.\nWe use OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) parts to fix your ice maker.
