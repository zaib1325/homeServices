Learning to identify these sounds and their causes will put you on the fast track to fix your noisy dryer.\\n\\n### The ABC's of Dryer Noises and What They Mean:\\n\\n* __Squeaking or squealing:__ These sounds often indicate an issue with the dryer's belt or rollers, either from worn-out parts or lack of lubrication.\\n* __Thumping or banging:__ If your clothes dryer is making a loud noise like this, it could be due to an unbalanced load or loose components such as drum support rollers or the blower wheel.\\n* __Rattling or grinding: This might be caused by loose items in the dryer drum or by loose screws or deteriorated parts creating a dryer making grinding noise.\\n\\n## Fixing Common Dryer Noises\\n\\nFollow this expert advice to fix a noisy dryer. When you’re unable to repair the problem yourself, [schedule repair service](/repair/dryer-repair-service) and we’ll send a Sears Home Services technician to your home to fix your dryer.\\n\\n### Squeaking or Squealing\\n\\nInspect the dryer belt and rollers for damage or wear. A worn idler pulley will also make a squealing noise so check that component for wear. Swap out any worn parts and lubricate the rollers if necessary.\\n\\nFollow the steps in this DIY repair video to replace the drive belt in a common type of clothes dryer:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hnMOYWmaEfI\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nUsing the steps to disassemble the dryer in the above video will also give you access to the drum rollers and idler pulley.\\n\\n### Thumping or Banging\\n\\nRedistribute an unbalanced load evenly and tighten or replace any loose components. A thumping noise in your dryer can also be caused by a drum roller that is flat on one side because the dryer sat idle for a long period of time.\\n\\nFollow the steps in this video to replace a bad drum support roller:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sdvltoSW5dE\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n### Rattling or Grinding Noise\\n\\nAlways check pockets for loose items before drying clothes to prevent these from causing noise. Tighten any loose screws and replace worn-out parts.\\n\\nGrinding noise in a dryer can be caused by worn drum glide bearings. Follow the steps in one of the videos provided above to remove the drum and check the glide bearings for wear and replace them if necessary.\\n\\n## Keep Your Dryer in Top Shape to Prevent it from Making Loud Noise\\n\\nRegular upkeep can significantly reduce noise and improve your dryer's performance. Here's how to keep your dryer running smoothly and quietly:\\n\\n* Always clean the lint screen after each use to prevent airflow restriction that can lead to noise. Regularly vacuum the lint trap housing and exhaust vent to prevent lint build-up.\\n* Examine components like belts, rollers, and bearings for signs of wear and tear, replacing them as needed. Follow the DIY procedures in our [Sears PartsDirect Dryer Repair Help]() section to replace worn parts or schedule repair service to have a Sears Home Services technician replace worn dryer parts.\\n* Lubricate moving parts like the motor bearings and pulleys with the manufacturer-recommended lubricant. Ensure the dryer is level and stable on the floor to prevent excessive vibrations and noise.\\n\\nRegular professional maintenance will help you avoid dryer noise and other failures. [Schedule Sears Home Services Clean \\u0026 Maintain Service](/maintain) for your laundry appliances yearly to keep them in top shape and running quietly. Annual professional maintenance will also help your appliances last longer.\\n\\nExcessive noise from your dryer may come from worn rollers, a loose belt, or damaged blower wheels.

If the temperature's too low, there may be an operational issue with the dryer, which should be checked by an authorized service technician.\\n\\n![check-the-kenmore-oven-gas-supply-valve](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/6jO3E4T6cs4YE2ROJpOP1x/3a3eb09ce55e898d84b8b0aa1fd65afd/check-the-gas-oven-gas-supply-cut-off-valve.png)\\n\\n### Improper or no electric or gas supply to the dryer\\n\\nIs there a proper electrical or gas supply to the dryer? Dryers get their electricity from a 240-volt circuit supplied by two 120-volt lines. If only one of the lines is working, the dryer will run but not heat up. With gas, the appliance won't heat if your gas is off. Both issues should be checked by a professional.\\n\\n![Cleaning the clothes dryer lint screen image](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/39hj26apmMRR59atSb3uH0/f94376869d611296a4570a54052460ea/Cleaning_the_clothes_dryer_lint_screen_image.jpg)\\n\\n### Clogged lint screen\\n\\nIf your lint screen is plugged up or dirty, it will reduce airflow and prevent clothes from drying. Remove as much excess lint as you can and soak the lint screen in hot water and dish soap. If needed, use a soft toothbrush to scrub the screen clean. \\n\\n### Uneven loads\\n\\nWhat type of load are you drying? If you mixed large and small items, that might be the problem. Washing and drying similar items together is imperative to proper performance. This is especially true on an auto dry cycle. Putting things like towels and sheets together can cause the dryer to heat at a lower level and sometimes even shut off, thinking the items are dry. The smaller or lighter clothes will be dry, but the larger, heavier items will still be damp. \\n\\n### Washer leaving clothes too wet\\n\\nThe dryer might not even be to blame — the issue could be with the washer. If your [washing machine isn't draining completely](/blog/top-reasons-your-washing-machine-is-leaving-clothes-wet) or isn't spinning enough water out of the clothes, it will be harder for the dryer to do its job.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Signs You Need to Hire a Dryer Repair Expert\\n\\nWhen your [dryer isn't working](/blog/dryer-not-working-problems-solutions), there are times when it's best to have a Sears Technician diagnose and fix the problem instead of attempting a DIY repair.\\n\\n![clothes-dryer-thermal-fuse](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/6LIFKI8ELZQu42Isr8TgDo/e254a7ca33ebe6cd6dae0a629ecfba71/clothes-dryer-thermal-fuse.png)\\n\\n### A faulty thermal fuse\\n\\nYou'll typically need to schedule a Sears Technician to examine and repair your dryer when it blows a thermal fuse. A clogged exhaust vent duct system usually causes the thermal fuse to blow. The dryer overheats and trips the thermal fuse when hot exhaust air can’t make it through the duct system to the outside of your home. Other problems such as faulty thermostats or temperature sensors can also cause the thermal fuse to blow. Having a service technician diagnose and repair the problem will ensure that the problem gets fixed properly and permanently.\\n\\n![clothes-dryer-heating-element-image](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/1S7vcotu4RWboPLmZpA4qG/9b397f01181d15e21c55baa175f37744/electric-heating-element-image.png)\\n\\n### A broken heating element\\n\\nWhen the heating element breaks in your dryer, the appliance will stop heating and clothes won’t get dry. Sometimes, the heating element can short to the metal inside the cabinet and cause an electrocution hazard. It’s best to have a service technician examine and repair the dryer when the heating element breaks.\\n\\n![samsung-high-temperature-safety-thermostat](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/Z29BGb9lM1t2ciCDpEMxu/292097d2a81bb9bebc67fcc3a70610fa/samsung-high-temperature-safety-thermostat.png)\\n\\n### A broken thermostat\\n\\nThermostats inside the dryer control drying temperature and prevent the dryer from overheating. When a thermostat breaks, the dryer can overheat or not heat at all. Because a dryer typically has several thermostats, it’s best to have a service technician examine your dryer and fix the problem.\\n\\n![dryer-timer-wont-turn-off-image](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/5WXqSUGmzIG2i3Httijvsi/ee9ccfbb18350c26bddbd7117ccc66fa/dryer-timer-wont-turn-off-image.png)\\n\\n### A defective timer motor\\n\\nA dryer with a dial timer typically has a timer motor that moves the control dial through the cycle. If the dial doesn’t move and dryer keeps running without stopping, the timer motor may be defective. Other problems can prevent the control dial from advancing to the end of the cycle so it's important to have a service technician diagnose and repair a timer failure.\\n\\n### A complex electrical or gas issue\\n\\nSome electrical failures are way too complicated for DIY'ers to diagnose and repair on their own. Finding and fixing electrical issues can be dangerous. Also, finding and repairing issues with the gas supply system in a gas dryer can be dangerous. Schedule a Sears Technician to diagnose and fix your dryer when you’re unable to determine why it won’t run or heat.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Troubleshooting Your Dryer Issues\\n\\nMany appliance repair DIY'ers view videos on YouTube and fix their dryers themselves. Although advanced repairs on gas and electric dryers are dangerous and risky, you may be able to troubleshoot some basic dryer failures on your own by watching our safe and easy-to-follow DIY repair videos.\\n\\n__Always unplug the dryer and shut off the gas supply before attempting any DIY repair and troubleshooting procedure.__\\n\\nFor an electric dryer that won’t heat, follow the troubleshooting tips in this video.\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VTnDslKW6y0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nWhen you have a gas dryer that doesn’t heat, follow the troubleshooting steps in this video.\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7KaMwV85qUI\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Trust the Dryer Repair Technicians at Sears Home Services to Get the Job Done\\n\\nSears dryer repair technicians know all the top dryer brands such as Whirlpool, Frigidaire, Samsung, GE, LG and Kenmore.

Here are some additional reasons why your dryer won't start:\\n\\n* The \\\"Control Lock\\\" is enabled on the control panel.\\n* A bad door switch is preventing the control from detecting that the door is shut.\\n* The house circuit breaker for the dryer is tripped.\\n* An internal thermal fuse has blown inside the dryer.\\n* The start switch is defective.\\n\\nIf your dryer has a control panel, you know it has power if the control panel lights up. If your dryer has a timer dial instead of a control panel, check for power by opening the dryer door and seeing whether the drum light turns on. If not, check the power cord to make sure it’s plugged in securely and check the house circuit breaker for the dryer to see if it has tripped. \\n\\nRestoring power to the dryer may fix the starting problem.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why Won't My Dryer Start all of a Sudden?\\n\\nThere are numerous reasons for a clothes [dryer suddenly not starting](/blog/dryer-maintenance-tips-you-need-to-know-update). Common dryer issues include a faulty door switch or start switch and control problems such as a broken dryer timer or faulty electronic control board:\\n\\n* Problems with the door switch can prevent the dryer from starting. To test the switch, open the door press in the door switch lever. If the drum light doesn’t turn off, a failed door switch is the likely reason the dryer won’t start.\\n* A blown thermal fuse often prevents an electric dryer from starting. You’ll find the thermal fuse on the blower housing. Unplug the dryer and check the thermal fuse for continuity. Replace the thermal fuse if the multimeter measures no continuity. Check the exhaust vent because a clog in the vent likely caused the thermal fuse to blow.\\n* For dryers with a dial timer, a broken push-to-start switch can prevent the motor from running. Use a multimeter to check for continuity through the push-to-start switch. Replace the push-to-start switch if you don’t measure continuity through the wires between the push-to-start switch and motor. It could instead be that the timer has a broken motor switch contact. Following the wiring diagram for the dryer, test for continuity through the wires between the timer and motor. If you don’t have the wiring diagram or this tasks sounds too complicated to do on your own, have a service technician check the timer.\\n* Electronically controlled dryers have a circuit board that operates the dryer’s components. A faulty circuit board prevents the dryer from starting. Unplug the dryer and then find the circuit board in the main control panel. It might have burn marks or areas that are shorted out. If the circuit board is faulty, it’s best to let a [professional handle the fix](/repair).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Troubleshooting Your Dryer Issues\\n\\nKnowing __what__ can prevent your dryer from starting is one thing – finding and fixing the problem yourself is a whole different ball game. To figure out why your electric dryer won’t start and learn how to fix it, watch this DIY repair video:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/thMya3ThQoQ\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nIf you have a gas dryer, use the advice in our [Gas dryer won’t start troubleshooting video](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/article/gas-dryer-wont-start-troubleshooting-video) to find and fix the problem.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Common Dryer Problems and Solutions\\n\\nA dryer uses a simple system to dry your clothes: An inner drum rotates wet clothes while circulating heated air through them to collect the moisture and then carry it out through the exhaust hose. Like most people, you probably use your dryer at least once a week. [Dryer care](/blog/dryer-life-hacks-that-change-laundry) is important. When you find the dryer not working, you want to fix the problem as quickly as you can. \\n\\nSome simple troubleshooting tips for gas and electric dryers help pinpoint the problem and determine if you can repair your dryer or if you need to make a service call to [get your dryer repaired](/repair/dryer-repair-service)  by a professional.\\n\\n### Dryer Not Working\\n\\nA dryer not drying clothes may be because of a broken part or because the dryer isn't getting enough power to operate. Before you start looking at the interior of the dryer, check the plug, power cord and breakers: \\n\\n1. Make sure the dryer is securely plugged in and that there is no damage or wear to the plug or cord. \\n2. If you have an electric dryer, check the breaker box to make sure the breaker hasn’t been thrown. Since your dryer operates on 240 volts, only one-half of a double breaker may be thrown. This could explain a dryer not heating even though it is running.\\n3. If you have a gas dryer, check the gas supply -- if it's not heating (or not running at all) you should check the breaker.\\n\\nOnce you rule out these simple fixes, you can look at how to fix a dryer that's not drying. Specific problems may include the following:\\n\\n- Dryer won’t heat\\n- Dryer won’t start\\n- Dryer won’t spin\\n- Dryer makes a lot of noise\\n- Dryer starts then stops\\n\\nImportant: Before doing tests or repairs, unplug the dryer. If you have a gas dryer, also shut off the gas supply.\\n\\n### Dryer Not Heating\\n\\nAn [electric dryer not heating](/blog/dryer-not-heating-5-diy-troubleshooting-tips-for-dryer-problems), even though it's running, is often due to a faulty dryer heating element. You can test the element with a tool called a multimeter. The tool tells you if there are breaks in the electrical path. The reading should be about 15 ohms. If there is no measure of continuity on the meter, replace the dryer heating element. \\n\\nBesides a broken heating element, several other failures in an electric dryer can keep it from heating.\\n\\nHere’s an advanced troubleshooting video that shows how to check all components inside a common electric dryer that will keep it from heating.\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VTnDslKW6y0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nA gas dryer will run but won’t heat if its thermal fuse blows because the dryer overheated (usually because the vent is clogged, so check the vent path). Use a multimeter to check the thermal fuse and [replace the thermal fuse](http://www.searspartsdirect.com/repair-guide/dryer/how-to-replace-a-thermal-fuse-in-a-gas-dryer.html) if you don’t’ measure continuity.\\n\\nIn addition to a blown thermal fuse, several other failures can prevent a gas dryer from heating.\\n\\nHere’s an advanced troubleshooting video that shows how to check all parts inside a common gas dryer that will keep it from heating.\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7KaMwV85qUI\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n### Dryer Not Starting\\n\\nWe covered troubleshooting for a clothes dryer not starting at the top of this article. Follow that advice to fix your dryer when it won’t start.\\n\\n### Dryer Drum Not Turning\\n\\nIf the dryer starts but the dryer drum won’t turn, the dryer might have a worn drum bearing or dryer belt. To test the bearing, remove the belt and try to turn the drum with your hand. If the drum doesn’t turn, the bearing needs to be replaced. \\n\\nIf you hear the dryer motor running but the dryer drum doesn’t turn, the drive belt could be broken. Unplug the dryer, check the drive belt and replace it if it's broken. Even if the belt isn't the cause of your dryer problems, it's a good time to [replace an old belt](http://www.searspartsdirect.com/repair-guide/dryer/how-to-replace-a-dryer-drive-belt.html) that could cause problems later.\\n\\n### Dryer Making Noises\\n\\nIf your dryer is making squeaking or squealing noises, the idler pulley assembly may be the cause. This assembly controls the tension on the drum belt through friction. Over time, the idler pulley may fail. \\n\\n### Dryer Starts Then Stops\\n\\nIt can be surprising when you start an electric dryer only to come back a few hours later to find your clothes are still wet. If your electric dryer starts and then stops too soon, a dryer thermal fuse could be the culprit if you have an electric dryer.\\n\\nThe dryer thermal fuse is a safety mechanism that detects the temperature of air flowing to the outside vent. If the air too hot, the fuse blows, stopping an electric dryer (a gas dryer keeps running but won't heat). Unfortunately, if the thermal fuse trips, it must be replaced before the dryer will work again. To help keep the thermal fuse from blowing again, perform the [dryer maintenance](/blog/clean-your-dryer-vent-regularly-reminder) described in your owner's manual.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Rely on Sears Home Services for Dryer Repairs and Maintenance\\n\\nTo keep your dryer running the way it should, pay attention to signs that the machine may be starting to fail.

If you have a heavy load in the dryer, remove some of the items. If you’re drying a heavy comforter or quilt, you may need to remove that item and dry it at a local laundromat or washateria.\\n* Check for foreign objects in the load. Heavy foreign objects such as knives or tools can cause loud thumping noise. Coins can cause loud rattling noises as the load tumbles. Remove any foreign objects and check pockets of garments before washing and drying garments.\\n* Adjust the leveling legs if the dryer thumps and you can detect movement as you push down on diagonally opposing corners of the dryer cabinet. Extend a leveling leg on one of the corners that rocks so that all 4 dryer feet are firmly on the floor and you detect no rocking when pressing down on opposing corners of the dryer cabinet.\\n\\nIf these basic and simple troubleshooting tips don’t help eliminate the dryer noise, then read on to get help with finding and resolving more complicated problems causing loud dryer noises.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Grinding Noise: Metal-on-Metal Sounds in Your Dryer\\n\\nA grinding noise in your dryer typically means parts inside are wearing out or coming loose.

The video below shows how to replace the motor but if you’re not confident that you can replace that part on your own, schedule [dryer repair](/repair/dryer-repair-service) service and we’ll send a Sears Home Services technician to your home to replace the motor.\\n\\nHow to replace a dryer drive motor:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CATt3buaCXs\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Thumping Noise\\n\\nThumping often occurs when the dryer drum wobbles or rotates unevenly. This noise can worsen over time, so don’t ignore it.\\n\\nIf the basic troubleshooting tips at the top of this article such as reducing load size, removing foreign objects from garment pockets and stabilizing the dryer leveling legs don’t resolve a dryer thumping noise, then one or more of the drum support rollers may have flat spot causing the thumping noise. This type of thumping noise will sound fast as the flat spot of the roller hits the drum frequently as the drum rotates.\\n\\nIf you hear this type of thumping noise, access the drum rollers as shown in the video provided in the above section and replace any drum rollers with flat spots to eliminate the thumping noise.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Preventing Noisy Dryer Problems\\n\\nTaking preventive measures saves you time and money in the long run by helping prevent dryer failures – including those that cause noise.\\n\\n* __Clean and Inspect the Dryer Regularly:__ Wipe down the drum, check for loose parts, and clean the lint screen filter after every load.\\n* __Balance Dryer Loads:__ Avoid overloading the dryer or running it with unbalanced loads to prevent uneven wear. Dry oversized items at a local washateria.\\n* __Use Manufacturer-Approved Parts:__ When replacing dryer components, stick with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts designed for your dryer brand and model.\\n* __Schedule Yearly Professional Maintenance:__ Have a service technician perform [dryer maintenance](/maintain), cleaning and inspections every year to keep your dryer in top shape and working safely. The technician will inspect all components including the belt, rollers, glides, and idler pulley. The tech will be able to see potential problems that could begin making noise and causing failures. The technician will make adjustments or recommend repairs that will resolve issues before they become major dryer failures.\\n\\nA loud dryer shouldn’t interrupt your household routine. By pinpointing the source of the noise and following these steps, you’ll restore your dryer’s quiet efficiency in no time.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf quick steps from the blog don’t calm the noise, more thorough checks are crucial.

But don’t panic, we’ll help you quickly identify the cause of the noise and provide expert advice to fix it—or have a technician fix it.\\\\n\\\\nIn this article, we’ll point out the common causes of the various dryer noises. We’ll also provide safe DIY advice for fixing common dryer failures that cause those awful sounds.\\\\n\\\\nRelax, we’ve got this covered.\\\\n\\\",\\\"keyTakeaway1\\\":\\\"Before diving into repairs, try simple fixes such as reducing the dryer load, checking for foreign objects like coins or tools, and ensuring the dryer is level by adjusting the leveling legs.\\\",\\\"keyTakeaway2\\\":\\\"Grinding noises often indicate worn glides, drum bearings, or drum support rollers. Squealing noises usually stem from faulty components like the idler pulley, drive belt, or motor bearings. Thumping sounds are typically caused by uneven loads or flat spots on drum support rollers, which may need replacement. Take immediate action when you hear these dryer noises.\\\",\\\"keyTakeaway3\\\":\\\"Regular cleaning, load balancing, and use of OEM parts can extend the life of the dryer and prevent noise-related failures. Annual professional maintenance, including inspections and adjustments, helps catch potential issues early and ensures the dryer operates efficiently and quietly.\\\",\\\"information\\\":\\\"$20\\\",\\\"secondaryClassification\\\":null,\\\"faqQuestion1\\\":\\\"Why does my dryer sound like its grinding?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer1\\\":\\\"Grinding noise can be caused by overloading the dryer. If you’re attempting to dry an unusually large load, pull some garments out to reduce the load. If you’re trying to dry a large item such as a comforter or quilt, pull that item out and dry it at a laundromat instead. Grinding noise can also be caused by worn drum glides or a damaged drum bearing. Examine and replace those components if needed. Other failures that could cause grinding noise in your dryer include: worn drum support rollers or a bad dryer ball hitch (in Frigidaire, Electrolux and some Kenmore and GE brand dryers).\\\",\\\"faqQuestion2\\\":\\\"Can I still use my dryer if it's making a loud noise?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer2\\\":\\\"No. Stop the dryer, unplug the power cord then find and fix the cause of the noise before using the dryer. Some noise problems are easy to find while more complicated failures will require service by an appliance repair technician.\\\",\\\"faqQuestion3\\\":\\\"How much does it cost to replace a dryer drum bearing?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer3\\\":\\\"The replacement drum bearing will typically cost between $20 and $80 for most dryers. If you replace the part yourself, the repair will only set you back the cost of the part. If you need to have a service technician complete the repair, you can expect to pay between $150 and $250 to replace a dryer drum bearing in most dryers.\\\",\\\"faqQuestion4\\\":\\\"Is it worth repairing a dryer?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer4\\\":\\\"In many situations, it is worth repairing a dryer. If you can complete a repair on your own, you’ll only need to pay the cost of the replacement part and dryer parts often aren’t very expensive (except for control boards and control panels). Almost all minor dryer repairs are worth making unless the dryer is over 10 years old. For major repairs that will cost over $300, you’re typically better off replacing the dryer if a repair will cost more than ½ the price of a replacement dryer and the dryer is over 7 years old. Making expensive repairs on an older dryer often doesn’t make sense because additional parts could soon wear out or fail.\\\",\\\"image\\\":{\\\"__typename\\\":\\\"Figure\\\",\\\"caption\\\":null,\\\"altText\\\":\\\"homeowner hearing the dryer making a loud noise\\\",\\\"onClickUrl\\\":null,\\\"tooltip\\\":null,\\\"height\\\":null,\\\"width\\\":null,\\\"image\\\":{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/37lnD0mgh96nhp4korI46y/2bc1f9c54ae06a425d503ba92d5a45e2/dryer-making-loud-noise.png\\\",\\\"height\\\":532,\\\"width\\\":834}},\\\"linkedResourcesTotal\\\":29}]},\\\"glossaryItems\\\":[{\\\"sys\\\":{\\\"id\\\":\\\"7aGx0o33OYNoD1m1hVrcoo\\\",\\\"publishedAt\\\":\\\"2025-03-25T15:00:03.456Z\\\"},\\\"title\\\":\\\"What is a Dryer Drum?\\\",\\\"term\\\":\\\"Dryer Drum\\\",\\\"slug\\\":\\\"what-is-a-dryer-drum\\\",\\\"shortDescription\\\":\\\"A dryer drum is the main interior component of a clothes dryer where clothes are placed to be dried.
