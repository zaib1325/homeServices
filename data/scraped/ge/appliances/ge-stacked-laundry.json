A repair technician can also recommend routine maintenance to extend your stacked laundry unit's life.\nWashing machine shaking or vibrating\nExcessive shaking or vibrating could indicate several problems, including something as minor as a bulky clothing item sticking to one side of the tub wall or adjusting the feet to level the machine.\nThere could also be more significant issues with your GE stacked laundry unit that require a repair technician, such as worn or failed shock absorbers or drive parts or tub bearings that are water damaged from a broken seal.\nWashing machine leaking water\nIf water is pooled at the front or back of your GE washer, the hot and cold water supply lines and the drain line could be poorly connected, blocked, or need replacement.\nIf it's a front-loading washer, the door seal might have failed. A clogged water pump filter can cause leakage, or the water pump itself could have failing seals and need to be replaced.\nImproper draining\nIf your GE washer won't drain, it could be as minor as a kinked or clogged drain hose. But more serious problems could be at hand, including a faulty lid switch, water level control, drain pump, or drive belt.\nWashing machine not spinning\nWhen a GE washer won't spin, the problem could be simple such as an overloaded drum or an improper load balance. Poor draining (see previous) can also prevent the spin cycle from initiating.\nThe washer could also have failed parts, such as the lid switch, a failed motor or spin solenoid, or a frayed or broken belt.\nWashing machine not filling with water\nIf your inlet lines are receiving water and have not become kinked, there could be a clogged inlet screen on one of the hoses. Barring those problems, your GE washer could be in need of a new inlet valve, lid switch, pressure switch, temperature selector, or even an electronic control board.\nAnnual maintenance\nScheduling regular appliance service ensures your GE stacked laundry unit will work efficiently and effectively.

The size of your household, which dictates how often the machine is used, will also affect its lifespan. Top-loading stacked laundry units typically last a few years longer than front-loading machines.\nIs it worth repairing a GE stacked laundry unit?\nIf your stacked laundry unit is less than 10 years old and the repair is less than half the cost of a new washing machine, it's typically more economical to repair the appliance.\nHow much does it cost to repair a GE stacked laundry unit?\nCosts for a GE stacked laundry unit repair can vary by the type of issue, and the parts and time required to complete the service. The average washing machine repair costs $200 to $265.\nReplacing a water sensor, a common repair, costs about $150, while installing a new stacked laundry unit gear case can exceed $300. Replacing an electronic control board can cost $300 to $500.\nIf your stacked laundry unit can't be repaired, you'll typically pay only a service appointment fee, and you'll be eligible for a discount on a new unit.\nFor homeowners with a Sears Home Services home appliance warranty plan, many services or replacements are covered, and any repairs are guaranteed for 180 days.\nWhat is the most common problem with GE washing machines & dryers?\nThe most common repairs are replacing the lid switch, leveling the washer, and cleaning or replacing the inlet hoses. The other most common parts failures in washing machines are the motor, coupler, water pump, drive belts, gaskets, and water inlet valves. Sears Home Services stocks or has quick access to replacement parts for many brands.\nThe most common dryer replacement parts are the heating element, thermal fuse, thermostat, and door switch, and Sears Home Services stocks replacement parts for many models. If your dryer is still under warranty, follow the requirements in the agreement.\nHow do you troubleshoot a GE stacked laundry unit?\nWhile you might use the owner's manual to troubleshoot some basic problems with your GE stacked laundry unit, it's often best to contact a certified Sears Home Service repair technician to diagnose the problem. If you're unsure whether you can solve the problem on your own, call Sears Home Service for expert service.\nWhat is the best way to prevent expensive GE dryer repairs?\nThe most important things to do on a regular basis to prevent part failures and extend the life of your GE dryer are to clean the lint filter after each use and intermittently clean the vents at the back of the machine and the outlet from the home.\nAllowing lint to build up can make your dryer overheat and cause parts to fail.

One of our laundry machine repair technicians will come to your home, quickly diagnose the problem, and efficiently execute the repair.\nWhile Sears Home Services stocks a multitude of parts for many brands of stacked laundry units, access to parts, especially for older machines, could delay repairs past the initial service call.\nSchedule your GE stacked laundry unit repair appointment today\nSears Home Services repair professionals are certified specialists you can trust for major household appliance repair services.

Top-loading stacked laundry units typically last a few years longer than front-loading machines.\nIs it worth repairing a GE stacked laundry unit?\nIf your stacked laundry unit is less than 10 years old and the repair is less than half the cost of a new washing machine, it's typically more economical to repair the appliance.\nHow much does it cost to repair a GE stacked laundry unit?\nCosts for a GE stacked laundry unit repair can vary by the type of issue, and the parts and time required to complete the service. The average washing machine repair costs $200 to $265.\nReplacing a water sensor, a common repair, costs about $150, while installing a new stacked laundry unit gear case can exceed $300. Replacing an electronic control board can cost $300 to $500.\nIf your stacked laundry unit can't be repaired, you'll typically pay only a service appointment fee, and you'll be eligible for a discount on a new unit.\nFor homeowners with a Sears Home Services home appliance warranty plan, many services or replacements are covered, and any repairs are guaranteed for 180 days.\nWhat is the most common problem with GE washing machines & dryers?\nThe most common repairs are replacing the lid switch, leveling the washer, and cleaning or replacing the inlet hoses. The other most common parts failures in washing machines are the motor, coupler, water pump, drive belts, gaskets, and water inlet valves. Sears Home Services stocks or has quick access to replacement parts for many brands.\nThe most common dryer replacement parts are the heating element, thermal fuse, thermostat, and door switch, and Sears Home Services stocks replacement parts for many models. If your dryer is still under warranty, follow the requirements in the agreement.\nHow do you troubleshoot a GE stacked laundry unit?\nWhile you might use the owner's manual to troubleshoot some basic problems with your GE stacked laundry unit, it's often best to contact a certified Sears Home Service repair technician to diagnose the problem. If you're unsure whether you can solve the problem on your own, call Sears Home Service for expert service.\nWhat is the best way to prevent expensive GE dryer repairs?\nThe most important things to do on a regular basis to prevent part failures and extend the life of your GE dryer are to clean the lint filter after each use and intermittently clean the vents at the back of the machine and the outlet from the home.\nAllowing lint to build up can make your dryer overheat and cause parts to fail. Annual maintenance by an appliance repair company to clean the machine and check for other problems can also prevent part failures and extend the life of your dryer.\nHow long does it take to repair a GE stacked laundry unit?\nWhen you request service, Sears Home Service can promptly schedule an appointment online or over the phone, often for same-day or next-day service in many areas. One of our laundry machine repair technicians will come to your home, quickly diagnose the problem, and efficiently execute the repair.\nWhile Sears Home Services stocks a multitude of parts for many brands of stacked laundry units, access to parts, especially for older machines, could delay repairs past the initial service call.\nSchedule your GE stacked laundry unit repair appointment today\nSears Home Services repair professionals are certified specialists you can trust for major household appliance repair services. Whether you own a GE washing machine or another manufacturer's product, our repair experts have years of experience making quality appliance repairs.\nFor excellent service on GE stacked laundry unit repairs or maintenance, contact the appliance pros at Sears Home Service either online or over the phone to schedule an appointment at a time that's convenient for you.

Our laundry machine repair experts serviced more than one million laundry appliances in the past year.\nSears Home Services also offers appliance maintenance plans to extend the life of your GE stacked laundry unit, home appliance warranties to cover many repairs and replacement, and replacement parts for your stacked laundry unit through Sears PartsDirect.\nGE washing machine repair issues we can fix\nThe experts at Sears Home Services can perform GE washing machine repairs whether your problem is big or small.\nA service call involves diagnosing the appliance's malfunction and making repairs quickly. A repair technician can also recommend routine maintenance to extend your stacked laundry unit's life.\nWashing machine shaking or vibrating\nExcessive shaking or vibrating could indicate several problems, including something as minor as a bulky clothing item sticking to one side of the tub wall or adjusting the feet to level the machine.\nThere could also be more significant issues with your GE stacked laundry unit that require a repair technician, such as worn or failed shock absorbers or drive parts or tub bearings that are water damaged from a broken seal.\nWashing machine leaking water\nIf water is pooled at the front or back of your GE washer, the hot and cold water supply lines and the drain line could be poorly connected, blocked, or need replacement.\nIf it's a front-loading washer, the door seal might have failed. A clogged water pump filter can cause leakage, or the water pump itself could have failing seals and need to be replaced.\nImproper draining\nIf your GE washer won't drain, it could be as minor as a kinked or clogged drain hose. But more serious problems could be at hand, including a faulty lid switch, water level control, drain pump, or drive belt.\nWashing machine not spinning\nWhen a GE washer won't spin, the problem could be simple such as an overloaded drum or an improper load balance. Poor draining (see previous) can also prevent the spin cycle from initiating.\nThe washer could also have failed parts, such as the lid switch, a failed motor or spin solenoid, or a frayed or broken belt.\nWashing machine not filling with water\nIf your inlet lines are receiving water and have not become kinked, there could be a clogged inlet screen on one of the hoses. Barring those problems, your GE washer could be in need of a new inlet valve, lid switch, pressure switch, temperature selector, or even an electronic control board.\nAnnual maintenance\nScheduling regular appliance service ensures your GE stacked laundry unit will work efficiently and effectively. It can also prevent costly, unexpected repairs over time and extend the life of your appliance.\nWhen you request the stacked laundry unit Clean & Maintain package, your Sears Home Services technician will inspect both appliances for proper functioning, wear and tear, excess noise, and water and gas leaks, while also cleaning internal components.\nWhy choose Sears Home Services for GE stacked laundry unit repair?\nWe know GE stacked laundry units\nSears Home Services experts are certified in servicing GE washing machines, as well as washing machines and major appliances from other manufacturers.

Regardless of where you bought your machine, we'll keep it running. Plus, we'll even offer a discount on a new unit if you decide against repairs.\nOur more than 1,500 appliance repair technicians nationwide bring an average of 10 years of experience in appliance repairs for many major brands such as Maytag, Whirlpool, Kenmore, Amana, LG, Electrolux, Frigidaire, Samsung, and Bosch. Our laundry machine repair experts serviced more than one million laundry appliances in the past year.\nSears Home Services also offers appliance maintenance plans to extend the life of your GE stacked laundry unit, home appliance warranties to cover many repairs and replacement, and replacement parts for your stacked laundry unit through Sears PartsDirect.\nGE washing machine repair issues we can fix\nThe experts at Sears Home Services can perform GE washing machine repairs whether your problem is big or small.\nA service call involves diagnosing the appliance's malfunction and making repairs quickly. A repair technician can also recommend routine maintenance to extend your stacked laundry unit's life.\nWashing machine shaking or vibrating\nExcessive shaking or vibrating could indicate several problems, including something as minor as a bulky clothing item sticking to one side of the tub wall or adjusting the feet to level the machine.\nThere could also be more significant issues with your GE stacked laundry unit that require a repair technician, such as worn or failed shock absorbers or drive parts or tub bearings that are water damaged from a broken seal.\nWashing machine leaking water\nIf water is pooled at the front or back of your GE washer, the hot and cold water supply lines and the drain line could be poorly connected, blocked, or need replacement.\nIf it's a front-loading washer, the door seal might have failed. A clogged water pump filter can cause leakage, or the water pump itself could have failing seals and need to be replaced.\nImproper draining\nIf your GE washer won't drain, it could be as minor as a kinked or clogged drain hose. But more serious problems could be at hand, including a faulty lid switch, water level control, drain pump, or drive belt.\nWashing machine not spinning\nWhen a GE washer won't spin, the problem could be simple such as an overloaded drum or an improper load balance. Poor draining (see previous) can also prevent the spin cycle from initiating.\nThe washer could also have failed parts, such as the lid switch, a failed motor or spin solenoid, or a frayed or broken belt.\nWashing machine not filling with water\nIf your inlet lines are receiving water and have not become kinked, there could be a clogged inlet screen on one of the hoses. Barring those problems, your GE washer could be in need of a new inlet valve, lid switch, pressure switch, temperature selector, or even an electronic control board.\nAnnual maintenance\nScheduling regular appliance service ensures your GE stacked laundry unit will work efficiently and effectively. It can also prevent costly, unexpected repairs over time and extend the life of your appliance.\nWhen you request the stacked laundry unit Clean & Maintain package, your Sears Home Services technician will inspect both appliances for proper functioning, wear and tear, excess noise, and water and gas leaks, while also cleaning internal components.\nWhy choose Sears Home Services for GE stacked laundry unit repair?\nWe know GE stacked laundry units\nSears Home Services experts are certified in servicing GE washing machines, as well as washing machines and major appliances from other manufacturers. From regular maintenance to troubleshooting a major issue, our experienced washing machine repair technicians can help keep your appliance running smoothly.\nFlexible scheduling\nBreakdowns often occur unexpectedly.

Sears Home Services warranties and protection plans can help ensure a long lifespan. Protect your GE stacked laundry unit by asking your certified technician about our Appliance Warranty Plans.\nGE washing machine repair FAQ\nHow long should a GE stacked laundry unit last?\nWith proper maintenance, you can count on your GE stacked laundry unit to perform well for a decade or more. The size of your household, which dictates how often the machine is used, will also affect its lifespan. Top-loading stacked laundry units typically last a few years longer than front-loading machines.\nIs it worth repairing a GE stacked laundry unit?\nIf your stacked laundry unit is less than 10 years old and the repair is less than half the cost of a new washing machine, it's typically more economical to repair the appliance.\nHow much does it cost to repair a GE stacked laundry unit?\nCosts for a GE stacked laundry unit repair can vary by the type of issue, and the parts and time required to complete the service. The average washing machine repair costs $200 to $265.\nReplacing a water sensor, a common repair, costs about $150, while installing a new stacked laundry unit gear case can exceed $300. Replacing an electronic control board can cost $300 to $500.\nIf your stacked laundry unit can't be repaired, you'll typically pay only a service appointment fee, and you'll be eligible for a discount on a new unit.\nFor homeowners with a Sears Home Services home appliance warranty plan, many services or replacements are covered, and any repairs are guaranteed for 180 days.\nWhat is the most common problem with GE washing machines & dryers?\nThe most common repairs are replacing the lid switch, leveling the washer, and cleaning or replacing the inlet hoses. The other most common parts failures in washing machines are the motor, coupler, water pump, drive belts, gaskets, and water inlet valves. Sears Home Services stocks or has quick access to replacement parts for many brands.\nThe most common dryer replacement parts are the heating element, thermal fuse, thermostat, and door switch, and Sears Home Services stocks replacement parts for many models. If your dryer is still under warranty, follow the requirements in the agreement.\nHow do you troubleshoot a GE stacked laundry unit?\nWhile you might use the owner's manual to troubleshoot some basic problems with your GE stacked laundry unit, it's often best to contact a certified Sears Home Service repair technician to diagnose the problem. If you're unsure whether you can solve the problem on your own, call Sears Home Service for expert service.\nWhat is the best way to prevent expensive GE dryer repairs?\nThe most important things to do on a regular basis to prevent part failures and extend the life of your GE dryer are to clean the lint filter after each use and intermittently clean the vents at the back of the machine and the outlet from the home.\nAllowing lint to build up can make your dryer overheat and cause parts to fail. Annual maintenance by an appliance repair company to clean the machine and check for other problems can also prevent part failures and extend the life of your dryer.\nHow long does it take to repair a GE stacked laundry unit?\nWhen you request service, Sears Home Service can promptly schedule an appointment online or over the phone, often for same-day or next-day service in many areas. One of our laundry machine repair technicians will come to your home, quickly diagnose the problem, and efficiently execute the repair.\nWhile Sears Home Services stocks a multitude of parts for many brands of stacked laundry units, access to parts, especially for older machines, could delay repairs past the initial service call.\nSchedule your GE stacked laundry unit repair appointment today\nSears Home Services repair professionals are certified specialists you can trust for major household appliance repair services.

Annual maintenance by an appliance repair company to clean the machine and check for other problems can also prevent part failures and extend the life of your dryer.\nHow long does it take to repair a GE stacked laundry unit?\nWhen you request service, Sears Home Service can promptly schedule an appointment online or over the phone, often for same-day or next-day service in many areas. One of our laundry machine repair technicians will come to your home, quickly diagnose the problem, and efficiently execute the repair.\nWhile Sears Home Services stocks a multitude of parts for many brands of stacked laundry units, access to parts, especially for older machines, could delay repairs past the initial service call.\nSchedule your GE stacked laundry unit repair appointment today\nSears Home Services repair professionals are certified specialists you can trust for major household appliance repair services. Whether you own a GE washing machine or another manufacturer's product, our repair experts have years of experience making quality appliance repairs.\nFor excellent service on GE stacked laundry unit repairs or maintenance, contact the appliance pros at Sears Home Service either online or over the phone to schedule an appointment at a time that's convenient for you.

Our laundry machine repair experts serviced more than one million laundry appliances in the past year.\nSears Home Services also offers appliance maintenance plans to extend the life of your GE stacked laundry unit, home appliance warranties to cover many repairs and replacement, and replacement parts for your stacked laundry unit through Sears PartsDirect.\nGE washing machine repair issues we can fix\nThe experts at Sears Home Services can perform GE washing machine repairs whether your problem is big or small.\nA service call involves diagnosing the appliance's malfunction and making repairs quickly. A repair technician can also recommend routine maintenance to extend your stacked laundry unit's life.\nWashing machine shaking or vibrating\nExcessive shaking or vibrating could indicate several problems, including something as minor as a bulky clothing item sticking to one side of the tub wall or adjusting the feet to level the machine.\nThere could also be more significant issues with your GE stacked laundry unit that require a repair technician, such as worn or failed shock absorbers or drive parts or tub bearings that are water damaged from a broken seal.\nWashing machine leaking water\nIf water is pooled at the front or back of your GE washer, the hot and cold water supply lines and the drain line could be poorly connected, blocked, or need replacement.\nIf it's a front-loading washer, the door seal might have failed. A clogged water pump filter can cause leakage, or the water pump itself could have failing seals and need to be replaced.\nImproper draining\nIf your GE washer won't drain, it could be as minor as a kinked or clogged drain hose. But more serious problems could be at hand, including a faulty lid switch, water level control, drain pump, or drive belt.\nWashing machine not spinning\nWhen a GE washer won't spin, the problem could be simple such as an overloaded drum or an improper load balance. Poor draining (see previous) can also prevent the spin cycle from initiating.\nThe washer could also have failed parts, such as the lid switch, a failed motor or spin solenoid, or a frayed or broken belt.\nWashing machine not filling with water\nIf your inlet lines are receiving water and have not become kinked, there could be a clogged inlet screen on one of the hoses. Barring those problems, your GE washer could be in need of a new inlet valve, lid switch, pressure switch, temperature selector, or even an electronic control board.\nAnnual maintenance\nScheduling regular appliance service ensures your GE stacked laundry unit will work efficiently and effectively. It can also prevent costly, unexpected repairs over time and extend the life of your appliance.\nWhen you request the stacked laundry unit Clean & Maintain package, your Sears Home Services technician will inspect both appliances for proper functioning, wear and tear, excess noise, and water and gas leaks, while also cleaning internal components.\nWhy choose Sears Home Services for GE stacked laundry unit repair?\nWe know GE stacked laundry units\nSears Home Services experts are certified in servicing GE washing machines, as well as washing machines and major appliances from other manufacturers.

A repair technician can also recommend routine maintenance to extend your stacked laundry unit's life. \\n\\n### Washing machine shaking or vibrating\\n\\nExcessive shaking or vibrating could indicate several problems, including something as minor as a bulky clothing item sticking to one side of the tub wall or adjusting the feet to level the machine. \\n\\nThere could also be more significant issues with your GE stacked laundry unit that require a repair technician, such as worn or failed shock absorbers or drive parts or tub bearings that are water damaged from a broken seal.\\n\\n### Washing machine leaking water\\n\\nIf water is pooled at the front or back of your GE washer, the hot and cold water supply lines and the drain line could be poorly connected, blocked, or need replacement. \\n\\nIf it's a front-loading washer, the door seal might have failed. A clogged water pump filter can cause leakage, or the water pump itself could have failing seals and need to be replaced.\\n\\n### Improper draining\\n\\nIf your GE washer won't drain, it could be as minor as a kinked or clogged drain hose. But more serious problems could be at hand, including a faulty lid switch, water level control, drain pump, or drive belt.\\n\\n### Washing machine not spinning\\n\\nWhen a GE washer won't spin, the problem could be simple such as an overloaded drum or an improper load balance. Poor draining (see previous) can also prevent the spin cycle from initiating. \\n\\nThe washer could also have failed parts, such as the lid switch, a failed motor or spin solenoid, or a frayed or broken belt. \\n\\n### Washing machine not filling with water\\n\\nIf your inlet lines are receiving water and have not become kinked, there could be a clogged inlet screen on one of the hoses. Barring those problems, your GE washer could be in need of a new inlet valve, lid switch, pressure switch, temperature selector, or even an electronic control board.\\n\\n### Annual maintenance\\n\\nScheduling regular appliance service ensures your GE stacked laundry unit will work efficiently and effectively. It can also prevent costly, unexpected repairs over time and extend the life of your appliance. \\n\\nWhen you request the [stacked laundry unit Clean \\u0026 Maintain package](/maintain/appliance-maintenance), your Sears Home Services technician will inspect both appliances for proper functioning, wear and tear, excess noise, and water and gas leaks, while also cleaning internal components.\\n\\n## Why choose Sears Home Services for GE stacked laundry unit repair?\\n\\n### We know GE stacked laundry units \\n\\nSears Home Services experts are certified in servicing GE washing machines, as well as washing machines and major appliances from other manufacturers.

You'll also learn about the average cost to expect for materials and installation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Vinyl Siding Cost by Type\\n\\n### Vinyl Shake Siding\\n\\nThe cost of vinyl shake siding can vary significantly based on several factors, such as the brand, quality, style, location, and the size of the project.\\nOn average, the cost of vinyl shake siding can range from $6 to $15 per square foot, including materials and installation. This cost may also vary depending on the complexity of the installation process, any additional features, and the contractor's labor charges.\\n\\n### Insulated Vinyl Siding\\n\\nYou may choose siding with additional insulation, particularly if your house tends to be poorly insulated. \\nThe average cost of installing insulated vinyl siding can range from $5 to $16 per square foot. This price includes the cost of the insulated siding, labor, and other installation expenses. Keep in mind that these are just estimates, and the actual cost might be different in your specific area and depending on your particular project details.\\n\\n### Board and Batten\\n\\nBoard and batten vinyl siding provides a bold look for cottage style homes. On average, the cost of board and batten vinyl siding can range from $5 to $10 per square foot for materials and installation. The average cost can vary depending on where you live and the details of your siding project.\\n\\n### Clapboard Siding\\n\\nVinyl clapboard siding mimics the look of overlapping horizontal wood planks. This is one of the most popular types of vinyl siding. Clapboard vinyl siding typically costs between $5 and $12 per square foot to install. The actual cost to install clapboard siding on your home will depend on the type of siding that you choose, complexity of the installation process, any additional features, and the contractor's labor charges.\\n\\n### Vertical Vinyl Siding\\n\\nThe cost of vertical vinyl siding can range from $3 to $9 per square foot for materials only. You’ll need to add the cost of siding installation by a local contractor to figure the total cost of your project.\\n\\n### Vinyl Log Siding\\nVinyl log siding is a type of exterior cladding for buildings that replicates the appearance of traditional log cabins or log homes. It’s designed to mimic the natural and rustic look of wood logs. The cost of this siding typically ranges from $5 to $10 per square foot. This estimate includes the cost of materials and labor. However, keep in mind that prices can vary significantly based on your location and the specific contractor you choose.\\n\\n### Vinyl Stone Siding\\n\\nVinyl stone siding comes in panels or tiles that are manufactured to resemble various types of natural stones, such as limestone, slate, or river rock. The panels are molded or embossed with textures and patterns that replicate the look and feel of genuine stone.\\n\\nThe cost of installing vinyl stone siding varies according to the type of stone that you choose and the area that you live in. This type of siding typically costs between $7 and $15 per square foot to install including materials and labor.\\n\\n### Vinyl Brick Siding\\n\\nVinyl brick siding is made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and is commonly used to cover and protect the exterior walls of homes. The cost of installing vinyl brick siding typically costs from $7 to $15 per square foot. The specific cost of covering your home with vinyl brick siding may vary based on your location and the cost of labor charged by local contractors.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Factors to Consider When Calculating Vinyl Siding Cost\\n\\nHow much your vinyl siding will cost depends on many factors in addition to the particular quality of siding you choose. The total area of your home’s exterior will determine the amount of siding needed. If your home is irregularly shaped, this makes for a more challenging installation and can result in more scrap and man-hours.\\n\\nIf you are not doing the installation yourself, there are labor costs to consider. If you need to remove your old siding before installation, this will add to the total, as well.\\n\\nThe [cost of siding](https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/siding/install-siding/) typically runs between $3 and $12 per square foot. You can approximate the exterior of your home as rectangles and triangles to estimate the total area. The area of any rectangular space is the base x height. The area of any triangular spaces is ½ base x height. The total area is the sum.\\n\\nYou can then multiply the total estimated area by the unit price to get the total cost of the siding. For example, if your home has an exterior area of 1,200 square feet, the total cost would be between $2 x 1,200 = $2,400 and $7 x 1,200 = $8,400.\\n\\nBut other materials you need to consider are nails, trim pieces, and so on. Soffits or fascia pieces may be anywhere from $1 and $20 per linear foot, depending on the material chosen. It’s also often a good idea to include 10% additional material, as this is often how much waste is produced by cutting pieces to the appropriate size.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How to Reduce Vinyl Siding Costs\\n\\nHere are some tips to help you lower the overall cost of your home siding replacement project.\\n\\n* Start by researching different vinyl siding options and suppliers. Compare prices from multiple vendors to find the best deals and discounts.\\n* If you have the necessary skills and experience, consider installing the vinyl siding yourself. DIY installation can save you money on labor costs.\\n* Higher-grade vinyl siding may offer better durability and aesthetics, but it can also be more expensive. Opt for mid-grade or budget-friendly vinyl siding that meets your needs and budget.\\n* Vertical siding can be less expensive than traditional horizontal siding. Additionally, it can give your home a unique and modern look.\\n* Inquire about any energy efficiency rebates or incentives available for choosing certain vinyl siding options. These rebates can help offset the initial costs.\\n* If your budget is tight, explore financing options that offer low-interest rates or special deals on home improvement projects.\\n\\nLocal service providers often offer several favorable financing options to help you complete your vinyl siding installation affordably. Explore these options with a siding consultant in your area to begin your vinyl siding installation.\"])",

Routine cleaning and lubrication, inspecting and tightening electrical connections, and replacing worn parts are key to maintaining optimal performance.\\n\\nCleaning and lubricating the moving parts of your garage door opener with a silicone-based lubricant can reduce friction and ensure smooth operation. Moreover, inspecting and tightening electrical connections can prevent erratic operation or garage opener light blinking. Finally, worn-out components such as springs, belts, and chains should be replaced to maintain optimal functionality. If you're unsure about performing these tasks, consider seeking professional assistance.\\n\\nChecking garage door travel is often an essential DIY troubleshooting step in resolving garage door opener problems that cause error codes. Follow the detailed steps in this helpful YouTube video to resolve travel problems with your garage door:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/giZuLTMIOzc\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n## Reason 2: Safety Sensor Problems -- Resolving Photo Sensor Issues\\n\\nA common reason for the Liftmaster blinking light on your garage door opener could be photo sensor issues. Photo sensors, which detect obstacles to prevent accidents, are a crucial safety feature.

If the problem persists, consider resetting the photo sensor alignment as per your garage door opener's manual.

Inspecting the wiring connections, repairing or replacing damaged wires, and ensuring proper electrical connections can help eliminate garage opener light blinking and ensure the smooth operation of your garage door opener. Unplug the garage door opener motor unit and examine all wiring connections using the owner’s manual as a reference.

A wiring diagram shows a map of the wires that connect all of the circuits in an appliance. \\n\\nWhen a component fails, you can trace the circuit through that component to know what to physically check to diagnose the failure.\\n\\nView this video to see an example of tracing a circuit and diagnosing a component failure in a refrigerator.\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yUKSrh59v4Q\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nAs shown in the video, you’ll need a [multimeter](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/product/2lghb1rknn-0092-207/id-utldm1) to check wiring and components in an appliance when diagnosing a failure. Our [How to use a multimeter to test electrical parts video](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/article/how-to-use-a-multimeter-to-test-electrical-parts-video) shows you how.\\n\\n![Multimeter for diagnosing appliance failures](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/225BIGjnHOmVDM3aJxAvOY/bf1019a27454ca0f563a44da2eeb539b/Multimeter_for_diagnosing_appliance_failures.png)\\n\\nAccurately diagnosing a failure using a wiring diagram and multimeter will help you buy the right part so you can get the appliance working again. \\n\\nCircuits in appliances can be more complicated than the one shown in the above video, but you can use this basic method of tracing and testing a circuit to understand possible causes of failures in your appliances.\\n\\nWhen working on your appliances, always heed this warning:\\n\\n**Undertaking repairs or maintenance to appliances or power equipment can be hazardous. Should you choose to undertake repairs or maintenance, you are assuming the risk of injury to your person or property. In an effort to reduce the risk, use the proper tools and safety equipment noted in the applicable guide and follow all instructions. Always** __UNPLUG__ **the appliance or disconnect electrical power by shutting off the house circuit breaker before beginning diagnosis and/or repair. Do not proceed until you are confident that you understand all of the steps and are capable of completing the repair. Some repairs or maintenance, however, should only be performed by a qualified technician.**\\n\\n[Schedule in-home service by a Sears Technician](/repair) when you encounter an appliance failure that you can’t fix yourself. \\nSears Technicians perform more than 3 million repairs annually and we have 1,500+ appliance experts employed nationwide. Sears is the # 1 appliance repair service in the country, delivering guaranteed quality and workmanship.\"])",
