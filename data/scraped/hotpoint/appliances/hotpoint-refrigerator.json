During the service call, they'll recommend options for ongoing maintenance, troubleshoot common issues, and make repairs. We stock most Hotpoint appliance parts and tools, so it's easier for our teams to handle repairs fast.\nRefrigerator not cooling\nCooling issues in a Hotpoint refrigerator can be caused by clogged coils, a bad condenser fan, or failing gaskets. First check to see if food packaging is blocking the vents. If that tip doesn’t help restore cooling, call the repair technicians at Sears Home Services to take a closer look and fix the problem.\nHotpoint refrigerator is running constantly\nWhen it sounds like your Hotpoint refrigerator is always running, it may be due to dirty or dusty coils, a faulty defrost timer, or failing control relays.

If it is, the water and ice dispenser  won’t work.\\n\\nTurn the child lock feature off if you find it enabled.

Check for a frozen water line or reservoir and thaw the freeze using a hair dryer on a low heat setting.\\n\\nThis tactic may fix the water dispenser.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Check the Water Supply\\n\\nCheck to see if the ice maker is getting water. Empty the ice bin into a container and store that ice in the freezer. Once the ice maker cycles a dumps a batch of ice, see if the ice mold is filled with water to make a new batch of ice or see if the ice maker dumps a second batch of ice.\\n\\nIf the ice maker is getting water and making ice, then you know that the water supply going to the refrigerator is okay.\\n\\nIf the ice maker isn’t getting water, replace the water filter if you haven’t replaced it within the last 6 months. This may restore the water supply.\\n\\nIf the water filter isn’t the problem, check the water supply going to the fridge using this procedure:\\n\\n1. Shut off the water supply cut-off valve for the refrigerator.\\n2. Disconnect the water supply line from the back of the refrigerator.\\n3. Place the end of the water supply line in a bucket and briefly open the water supply cut-off valve.\\n\\nIf water doesn’t flow from the end of the water line, have a plumber fix the water supply going to the refrigerator.\\n\\nIf water flows from the end of the water supply line, then you know that the house water supply for the refrigerator is okay.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![check-the-refrigerator-water-valve](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/28QaHepQAqYgtpv9aLunf6/8934882ce37114d2e18b66d4b12ae4b4/replacing-the-refrigerator-inlet-water-valve.png)\\n\\n## Examine the Inlet Water Valve\\n\\nIf the water supply going to the refrigerator is okay, then __unplug the fridge__ and check the wire harness connection on the inlet water valve.\\n\\nReconnect the inlet water valve wires if you find them loose or disconnected.\\n\\nIf the wire harness connection is okay, then a bad water inlet valve could be preventing the water dispenser and ice maker from getting water. Other failures such as a damaged internal wire or bad control component could keep the water inlet valve from working. \\n\\nSchedule [refrigerator repair](/repair/refrigerator-repair-service) service to have a technician check the water valve circuit. The tech will need to conduct a live voltage check to see if the valve is getting voltage when you press the dispenser lever. If the valve is getting voltage but not opening to supply water to the water dispenser and ice maker, then the technician will replace the water inlet valve.\\n\\nIf you suspect that the water valve is defective and you want to replace it yourself without further diagnosis, follow the steps in this video to install a new water inlet valve:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tU4UK2ELxOM\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nReplacing the inlet water valve without a full diagnosis of the problem is a risk but it may fix the water dispenser failure.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![disassembled-water-dispenser](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/I1NwsyW8DCZeU6v1k93vO/38da94c94c6128014b0d7cd5a25714b8/disassembled-refrigerator-dispenser.png)\\n\\n## Water Dispenser Control Problems\\n\\nA failed micro-switch or bad dispenser control board can prevent the water dispenser working.\\n\\nWhen the troubleshooting steps outlined above don’t help you fix a water dispenser failure, schedule [refrigerator repair](/repair/refrigerator-repair-service) service to inspect the dispenser components and find the cause of the failure.\\n\\n## How to know if your refrigerator water valve is bad\\n\\nA service technician will check to see if the valve is getting electrical current when actuated. If the valve coil is getting current but doesn’t open, the technician will replace the water valve. This type of live voltage check isn’t safe for DIY’ers. To check the water inlet valve on your own, unplug the refrigerator and check the resistance through the water valve solenoid coil using a multimeter. The meter should typically measure 200 to 500 ohms of resistance if it’s good. If the meter measures infinite resistance, replace the water valve because it is bad.\\n\\n### Cost to replace a water inlet valve on a refrigerator\\n\\nIf you can replace the water inlet valve yourself, then all that you’ll spend is the price of the replacement part – typically between $20 and $100. If you need to have a service technician replace the valve, that repair will typically cost you between $150 and $300.\\n\\n### Life expectancy of a water valve\\n\\nRefrigerator water valves typically last 15 to 20 years but a failure in this type of device can occur at any time.\\n\\n---\\n\\nKnowing about the different types of failures that can prevent your refrigerator water dispenser from working will help you determine the right corrective action to take.\\n\\nAlthough you can fix some fridge water dispenser issues on your own, more complicated failures will require a visit from a technician.\\n\\nWhen you need a technician to fix your refrigerator water dispenser, trust [Sears Home Services](/repair) to get the job done.

Chances are it isn’t cooling as it should. But why is it suddenly on the fritz?\\n\\nTo get to the bottom of the issue, Sears Home Services refrigeration experts shared their answers to the most common reasons your fridge might stop cooling properly. While some of the issues have relatively simple fixes, some of these [refrigerator problems](/blog/top-most-common-refrigerator-repairs-update) will need a service call.\\n\\n**These answers will help you figure out why your fridge isn’t cooling, first start with the easy tasks you can do yourself. If these simple adjustments don’t fix the problem, it’s time to call in the pros.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why is the temperature control setting on my refrigerator wrong?\\n\\nUh-oh, did something bump into your temperature control panel? Before you do anything else, check this first. As one of the most common snafus, it’s almost like asking “Is it plugged in?” Move the control thermostat to a cool setting, and that should do the trick. You may need to wait a few hours for the temperature to return to normal after adjusting the temperature settings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What should I do if my refrigerator condenser coils are full of dust?\\n\\nIf you’ve been neglecting your condenser coils, you’ll want to clean them ASAP. When the coils have a buildup of dust on them, the coils won’t be able to remove the heat from the refrigerant flowing through it properly. Thankfully, fixing this problem is as easy as dusting. Locate your appliance’s condenser coils — they’re typically in the back or on the bottom of the fridge — and use a brush to get rid of dust. They even make a [special brush](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/product/5othfqw3jp-0046-106/id-4210463rw) just for this purpose. To help keep your fridge running smoothly, our pros recommend you clean the coils a couple of times a year. Here’s a video that shows how to clean the condenser coils.\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SwA5dMW9bhg\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How do I know if my refrigerator’s gaskets need to be replaced?\\n\\nOver time, the seals around the refrigerator doors, known as gaskets, suffer from wear and tear. When this happens, they don’t seal as well as they should, so the cool air inside gets mixed with warm air entering through the unsealed door. Check to see if your door gaskets have any cracks or tears or are loose. If so, the gaskets will need to be replaced.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Could my refrigerator be overloaded?\\n\\nWhen’s the last time you cleaned out all those leftovers? If you can’t remember, it’s time to do a purge and toss anything that’s looking a bit suspect. Overloaded fridges can’t circulate cold air properly, and there’s also a possibility that items in your fridge could be blocking the airflow from the vent.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Does it matter where my refrigerator is located?\\n\\nThe room environment where the refrigerator is placed can affect its thermometer. If the space is too cold, like a second fridge in the garage, it might shut off because the appliance thinks it’s already up to temp. If the room is too hot, it could run constantly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What should I do if the refrigerator fan motor isn’t working?\\n\\nThis is where we get into some of the more serious issues. The condenser fan motor turns the fan blade for cool air circulation, and if neither your fridge nor freezer is cooling properly, it’s possible the fan motor is malfunctioning. You’ll want a technician to come out to fix this.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How will I know if the evaporator fan motor is broken?\\n\\nIf your fridge isn’t cooling properly, a faulty evaporator fan could be the reason. Sometimes a squealing or trilling noise is a clue that the evaporator fan is failing, especially if the noise is louder when you open the freezer door.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Is it possible that my refrigerator’s start relay is faulty?\\n\\nA failed compressor start relay causes problems with your fridge’s compressor, aka the part that circulates the refrigerant through the system. Remove the relay and test to make sure the connection isn’t fried by shaking it. If you hear a rattle, it’s time to replace it.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why is my refrigerator warm, but my freezer is cool?\\n\\nIf your freezer compartment is cold but the refrigerator temperature seems warmer than usual, make sure none of the food containers in the fridge are blocking airflow at the vents; the owner’s manual usually shows where the air vents are located. It’s possible the air damper that allows air through the vent is stuck closed; you may need a technician to check this. Your refrigerator might seem warmer than usual for a day if you’ve just added a lot of food—wait 24 hours after adding a lot of food to see if the refrigerator cools properly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## When to call a professional to fix a fridge that doesn’t cool\\n\\nWhile there are some problems you can try tackling yourself, if the compressor or other components of the sealed system such as the condenser or evaporator coils are the issue, you’ll need to hire a certified repair technician to [repair your refrigerator](/blog/common-refrigerator-and-freezer-problems-guide). A service technician can easily identify other problems such as a defrost heater, defrost timer, thermistor and electronic control boards malfunctions.\\n\\n### Hire a Refrigerator Repair Expert from Sears Home Services\\n\\nSears Home Services is a nationwide leader in refrigerator repair with over 1,500 local appliance service technicians available across the US.

Unblocking air vents may fix the cooling problem in your fridge.\\n\\nHigh fridge temperatures are also a sign of control system problems, a failure in the air control damper, low refrigerant charge and other malfunctions. Follow the DIY troubleshooting tips in these videos to restore proper cooling in your refrigerator:\\n\\n* [Troubleshooting a refrigerator not cooling video](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/article/troubleshooting-a-refrigerator-not-cooling-video)\\n* [Diagnosing refrigerator evaporator fan problems video](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/article/diagnosing-refrigerator-evaporator-fan-problems-video)\\n* [Diagnosing refrigerator thermistor problems video](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/article/diagnosing-refrigerator-thermistor-problems-video)\\n* [Troubleshooting defrost system problems video](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/article/refrigerator-wont-cool-troubleshooting-video-defrost-system-problems)\\n\\nThese expert tips may help you fix the refrigerator cooling problem. If not, [schedule refrigerator repair service](/repair/refrigerator-repair-service) and we’ll send a Sears Technician to your home to fix the fridge.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Won’t Power Up\\n\\nWhen you find the fridge completely dead, check the control to make sure the fridge is turned on. If that doesn’t fix the problem, check the house circuit breaker for your fridge. Reset the circuit breaker in case it has tripped.\\n\\nIf the fridge won’t power up after resetting the house circuit breaker, check the electrical outlet. Make sure the refrigerator outlet cord is securely plugged in. \\n\\nIf the outlet cord is plugged in, test the electrical outlet by plugging in a lamp or other small appliance to verify that the outlet is working.\\n\\nIf the outlet has no power, have an electrician fix the outlet.\\n\\nIf the outlet works, check the refrigerator power cord for damage. Replace the power cord if you find damage.\\n\\nIf the outlet cord is good, then a failed electronic control board or bad control panel could be causing the problem. These parts are expensive. You’ll likely need to [have a service technician diagnose and repair the fridge](/repair) if basic troubleshooting doesn’t help you find the cause of the failure.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Excessive Frost in the Freezer\\n\\nWhen snowy frost coats items in the freezer, check for loose spots or damage in the door gaskets that could be letting in warm, moist air. That moist air will cause the excessive frost in the freezer compartment.\\n\\nYou may be able to fix the problem by pushing a loose door gasket back into its channel. If you find a torn or damaged door gasket, you’ll need to replace it.

Check to see if the ice dispenser door closes properly. Remove a stuck ice cube if that’s what you find keeping the door from closing. Replace the ice dispenser door flap if it’s damaged or broken.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Ice Maker Not Working\\n\\n Several problems can prevent ice production in the freezer or ice compartment. The ice maker could be jammed or broken, a dirty water filter or kinked water line could be blocking water flow or the water inlet valve could be clogged or faulty. A control board problem can also kill ice production.\\n\\nBecause many ice makers are controlled by electronic circuit boards, you can sometimes fix the problem by shutting off the ice maker then turning it back on. If that doesn’t fix the ice maker, disconnect power to the entire fridge for several minutes to reset all circuit boards in the refrigerator. Power the refrigerator back up and see if the ice maker works. If it does, then you’ve likely fixed the problem.\\n\\nIf this initial repair tip didn’t fix the ice maker, try these additional troubleshooting steps:\\n\\n* Check the ice maker for jammed cubes and clear any ice buildup that you find.\\n* See if the refrigerator water dispenser works. If not, replace the water filter. If that doesn’t help restore water flow, then you’ll likely need to [replace the water valve](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/repair-guide/how-to-replace-the-water-inlet-valve-in-a-top-freezer-refrigerator) if it's clogged or won't fill the ice maker when activated. \\n* No ice in the ice maker also could mean that your refrigerator isn't cooling-the ice maker won't cycle if the freezer is warmer than 5 degrees F. Check freezer temperature and fix the cooling problem if the freezer isn’t cooling properly.\\n\\nIf these troubleshooting steps don’t help you fix the ice maker, you’ll likely need to [have a service technician diagnose and repair the failure](/repair).\\n\\n---\\n\\n![Image of woman viewing refrigerator error code](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/tCi9c00N5eiW1t5ahEenu/9e301e1288e76ec3d9d8c43276dae716/Image_of_woman_viewing_refrigerator_error_code.jpg)\\n\\n## Refrigerator Displays an Error Code\\n\\nMany refrigerators have an electronic control board that detect failures for you and display and error code on the control panel. You can quickly figure out what’s wrong with this type of fridge—as long as you can crack the code. \\n\\nWhen you see a code displayed on the control panel of your refrigerator, use our [Refrigerator Error Code Charts](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/error-codes/refrigerator-repair/1234589) to determine the cause of the code and get DIY troubleshooting tips to fix your fridge.\\n\\nAt some point, you may find that you’re unable to complete the error code troubleshooting, or you’re unable to determine the cause of the failure after following the repair steps listed for an error code. In that situation, you’ll likely need to have a service technician diagnose and repair your fridge.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## When to Replace Your Fridge Instead of Repairing It\\n\\nWhen your refrigerator is over 10 years old and a repair is going to cost you half as much as buying a new fridge, then it’s typically time to replace the refrigerator instead of repairing it.\\n\\n![Upgrade You Appliances Image](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/29MiEr9HvIZJDc3QyipZ3Z/1adb7ce2ad6e29187f35920f2612929b/Upgrade_You_Appliances_Image.png)\\n\\nWhen the time comes to replace your fridge, or all of your kitchen appliances, [visit our Sears.com website](https://www.sears.com) to easily select the products you need and get help with financing.\\n\\nEfficient and durable appliances help make a house a home.

Finding the cause of a cooling problem is essential to fixing the the first step to fixing the fridge. Some causes are simple to find and easy to correct, while others may require advanced diagnosis and repair by an appliance technician.\\n\\nIf you’re willing, you can eliminate the simple causes of fridge cooling problems yourself. Follow these simple troubleshooting steps first when you face cooling problems in your refrigerator.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Check for Blocked Air Vents\\n\\nBlocked air vents can prevent cool air from flowing through the inside of your fridge. The owner’s manual typically shows you where these air vents are located. Find the vents inside your refrigerator and freezer and remove any items that are blocking air flow.\\n\\nOverpacking or cluttering the inside of the refrigerator or freezer compartment can also inhibit proper air flow and cooling. Toss out expired and spoiled foods regularly to prevent clutter. Organize foods in your fridge to help them last longer and promote proper air flow as shown in this video:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HC-G7e6qcPE\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Adjust the Temperature Controls\\n\\nFor optimal cooling performance, it's recommended to maintain temperatures between 35 degrees and 39 degrees in the refrigerator compartment. Setting the fridge temperature at 37 degrees is recommended in most owner’s manuals. Freezer temperature should typically be set at 0 degrees.\\n\\nWhen your fridge isn’t cooling well, check if the temperature controls are correctly set. Temperature setting changes may occur if the controls are accidentally touched. Children are sometimes tempted to play with fridge controls. If your refrigerator is malfunctioning due to this issue, adjust the controls to the desired temperature settings. Keep in mind that the temperature changes will not be immediate and could take up to 24 hours for complete equalization of cooling in the fridge.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Look for Loose, Damaged or Dirty Door Gaskets\\n\\nThe door gasket seals help trap cold air inside and keep warm out of your fridge. Check to see if your door gaskets have any cracks or tears or are loose. If a gasket is loose, push it back into the channel around the door or replace it if necessary. You’ll also need to replace any cracked or torn door gaskets.\\n\\nIf the door gaskets are intact but dirty, clean them with mild soap and water to remove spills and deposits. Coat the gaskets lightly with petroleum jelly to keep them lasting longer and sealing properly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Check for Proper Installation\\n\\nRefer to the installation guide to complete this troubleshooting step. Retrace the installation steps to see whether your fridge is installed in a proper location with plenty of room on the top, sides and back of the cabinet for ventilation. Most refrigerators need at least ½-inch on each side and 1-inch of clearance on the top and back. Adjust or move the fridge if necessary to gain proper ventilation space around the cabinet.\\n\\n### Ambient Temperature and Humidity Can Affect Cooling\\n\\nIf you’re having cooling trouble with a refrigerator located in the garage, keep in mind that most refrigerators are intended for indoor use where ambient temperatures don’t fluctuate drastically. Your installation guide provide ambient temperature limits for the fridge. When your fridge is in an environment outside those temperature limits, it won’t cool properly. Also, high humidity in some garages can cause cooling problems. The high humidity can cause excessive frost in the fridge that inhibits airflow through the evaporator. Consider moving the refrigerator indoors if possible when it isn’t cooling due to harsh environmental conditions in the garage.\\n\\n### Level the Fridge for Proper Operation and Cooling\\n\\nFollow the directions in your installation guide to properly level the fridge. Most fridges need to have a slight backward tilt so that doors swing shut smoothly and don’t stay cracked open. Adjust the leveling legs if your fridge isn’t leveled properly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Clean Refrigerator Condenser Coils\\n\\nIf you’ve been neglecting your condenser coils and your fridge isn’t cooling, you’ll want to clean them ASAP. When the coils have a buildup of dust on them, the coils won’t be able to remove the heat from the refrigerant flowing through it properly. Thankfully, fixing this problem is as easy as dusting. Locate your appliance’s condenser coils — they’re typically in the back or on the bottom of the fridge — and use a brush to get rid of dust.

one of the most convenient features in modern kitchens. It’s frustrating when you press the lever, only to find no water flowing. \\\\n\\\\nBefore calling a repair technician, you can sometimes troubleshoot and resolve the issue yourself.\\\\n\\\\nHere's a detailed guide to fixing a refrigerator water dispenser that isn’t working.\\\\n\\\",\\\"keyTakeaway1\\\":\\\"Check and disable the dispenser's child lock feature, which can prevent the water and ice dispenser from working. This is a quick and easy solution that resolves many issues.\\\",\\\"keyTakeaway2\\\":\\\"Investigate potential issues like a frozen water line or reservoir, a clogged water filter, or an interrupted water supply. Thaw frozen components and replace the water filter if it hasn't been changed in the last six months.\\\",\\\"keyTakeaway3\\\":\\\"If basic troubleshooting doesn’t work, inspect more complex parts such as the water inlet valve and the dispenser control board. If these components fail, professional diagnosis or replacement might be required.\\\",\\\"information\\\":\\\"$1e\\\",\\\"secondaryClassification\\\":null,\\\"faqQuestion1\\\":\\\"Why does my refrigerator water dispenser stop working even though the fridge is cooling properly?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer1\\\":\\\"A refrigerator can cool normally while the water dispenser fails because the two systems operate independently. Common causes include the dispenser child lock being turned on, a frozen water reservoir or supply line, a clogged water filter, or a faulty inlet water valve. Cooling issues affect the compressor, while dispenser problems are usually related to water flow or electrical controls.\\\",\\\"faqQuestion2\\\":\\\"How can I tell if the problem is my refrigerator or my home’s water supply?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer2\\\":\\\"An easy way to confirm this is by checking whether the ice maker is producing ice. If the ice maker is working, the refrigerator is receiving water from the home supply. If not, disconnect the water line from the back of the refrigerator and briefly open the shut-off valve into a bucket. No water flow indicates a household plumbing issue, while good flow points to a refrigerator component problem.\\\",\\\"faqQuestion3\\\":\\\"Can a frozen water line really stop the dispenser from working?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer3\\\":\\\"Yes. Many refrigerators use a water reservoir or coiled tubing inside the fresh food compartment to chill drinking water. If the refrigerator temperature is set too low or airflow is restricted, this tubing can freeze and block water flow. Gently thawing the line with a hair dryer on low heat often restores normal operation.\\\",\\\"faqQuestion4\\\":\\\"When should I call a professional instead of attempting a DIY repair?\\\",\\\"faqAnswer4\\\":\\\"If basic troubleshooting steps don’t restore water flow—or if the issue involves electrical testing, live voltage checks, or control boards—it’s best to call a professional. Components like inlet water valves and dispenser control boards require specialized tools and safety procedures. A Sears Home Services technician can accurately diagnose the problem and complete the repair safely and efficiently.\\\",\\\"image\\\":{\\\"__typename\\\":\\\"Figure\\\",\\\"caption\\\":null,\\\"altText\\\":\\\"Homeowner discovering the refrigerator water dispenser not working\\\",\\\"onClickUrl\\\":null,\\\"tooltip\\\":null,\\\"height\\\":null,\\\"width\\\":null,\\\"image\\\":{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/wG9WnOn121b2dfKZIROwE/7b51e7f398afa7043e543fb582f5b0b2/refrigerator-dispenser-not-working.png\\\",\\\"height\\\":475,\\\"width\\\":851}},\\\"linkedResourcesTotal\\\":49},{\\\"sys\\\":{\\\"id\\\":\\\"6kINnHPbpUTXnguplNPlR5\\\",\\\"publishedAt\\\":\\\"2026-01-05T11:14:05.938Z\\\"},\\\"slug\\\":\\\"how-to-fix-a-refrigerator-that-is-not-cooling-guide\\\",\\\"title\\\":\\\"How to Fix a Refrigerator That Is Not Cooling\\\",\\\"shortDescription\\\":\\\"When your refrigerator fails to keep things cool, it’s more than just an inconvenience—it’s a race against time to salvage your perishables.\\\",\\\"creationDateTime\\\":\\\"2023-08-03T11:53:00.000-07:00\\\",\\\"productType\\\":\\\"Refrigerator\\\",\\\"category\\\":\\\"REPAIR\\\",\\\"intro\\\":\\\"When your refrigerator fails to keep things cool, it’s more than just an inconvenience—it’s a race against time to salvage your perishables.
