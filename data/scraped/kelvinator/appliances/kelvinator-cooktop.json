A service call involves diagnosing the appliance's malfunction and making repairs quickly. A repair technician can also recommend routine maintenance to extend your cooktop's life.\nCooktop indicator lights won't turn on\nMany cooktops have displays with indicator lights for temperature settings. If any displays are malfunctioning, the control switch might have failed or a bulb has burned out.\nGas burners heat up too slowly\nWhen your Kelvinator cooktop gas burners are heating up too slowly, the burner openings emitting the gas could be obstructed or clogged. The good news is that a thorough cleaning will likely solve the problem. Other potential problems are a misaligned burner cap or faulty control valve. Schedule cooktop repair service if cleaning and basic troubleshooting doesn’t fix the problem.\nElectric cooktop burners won't heat up properly\nWhen one of your Kelvinator cooktop's burners won't heat up, the coil element may not have re-engaged properly the last time you removed it to clean the cooktop. If that's not the problem, it might be a faulty element. If a burner fails to mirror the heat setting, it could be a faulty infinite switch.\nDamaged electric coil element\nThe electric coil elements on a cooktop can wear out over time, especially with heavy use. If you see any blisters or breaks in the coil, it has likely lost continuity and needs to be replaced. If you have a glass or ceramic cooktop, the coils are located underneath the surface.\nA burner not heating properly also could be a sign of other problems, such as a damaged receptacle, faulty wiring, or a failed surface element switch.\nGlass cooktop surface is cracked or otherwise damaged\nIt could happen to anybody--a pan or other heavy object slips out of your hand and cracks your glass-ceramic cooktop. A cooktop can also be damaged when a surface element's thermal limiter fails and the burner overheats causing a thermal crack.\nWhile resin touch-up kits may be suitable to repair small chips or tiny cracks, any substantial damage requires replacement of the smooth glass-ceramic surface. You shouldn't use the cooktop (or the oven if your cooktop is part of a range or stove) until you repair or replace it.\nPreventive cooktop maintenance\nThe most important thing you can do to prevent cooktop malfunctions is to keep your cooktop clean. Scheduling annual appliance maintenance service also ensures your Kelvinator cooktop will work efficiently and effectively. Professional cooktop maintenance can prevent costly, unexpected repairs over time and extend the life of your appliance.\nWhen you request the Kitchen Appliance Clean & Maintain package, your Sears Home Services technician will inspect your cooktop and other kitchen appliances for proper functioning, wear and tear, and water or gas leaks, while also cleaning internal components.\nWhy choose Sears Home Services for Kelvinator cooktop repair?\nOur appliance repair experts know Kelvinator cooktops\nSears Home Services experts are certified in servicing Kelvinator cooktops, as well as cooktops and major appliances from other manufacturers.

Our cooktop repair experts service hundreds of thousands of cooking appliances each year.\nSears Home Services also offers appliance maintenance plans to extend the life of your Kelvinator cooktop, home appliance warranties to cover many repairs and replacement, and replacement parts for your cooktop through Sears PartsDirect.\nKelvinator cooktop repair issues that we can fix\nRegardless of the type of cooktop you own, the appliance repair experts at Sears Home Services can perform quality Kelvinator cooktop repairs for problems big or small. A service call involves diagnosing the appliance's malfunction and making repairs quickly. A repair technician can also recommend routine maintenance to extend your cooktop's life.\nCooktop indicator lights won't turn on\nMany cooktops have displays with indicator lights for temperature settings. If any displays are malfunctioning, the control switch might have failed or a bulb has burned out.\nGas burners heat up too slowly\nWhen your Kelvinator cooktop gas burners are heating up too slowly, the burner openings emitting the gas could be obstructed or clogged. The good news is that a thorough cleaning will likely solve the problem. Other potential problems are a misaligned burner cap or faulty control valve. Schedule cooktop repair service if cleaning and basic troubleshooting doesn’t fix the problem.\nElectric cooktop burners won't heat up properly\nWhen one of your Kelvinator cooktop's burners won't heat up, the coil element may not have re-engaged properly the last time you removed it to clean the cooktop. If that's not the problem, it might be a faulty element. If a burner fails to mirror the heat setting, it could be a faulty infinite switch.\nDamaged electric coil element\nThe electric coil elements on a cooktop can wear out over time, especially with heavy use. If you see any blisters or breaks in the coil, it has likely lost continuity and needs to be replaced. If you have a glass or ceramic cooktop, the coils are located underneath the surface.\nA burner not heating properly also could be a sign of other problems, such as a damaged receptacle, faulty wiring, or a failed surface element switch.\nGlass cooktop surface is cracked or otherwise damaged\nIt could happen to anybody--a pan or other heavy object slips out of your hand and cracks your glass-ceramic cooktop. A cooktop can also be damaged when a surface element's thermal limiter fails and the burner overheats causing a thermal crack.\nWhile resin touch-up kits may be suitable to repair small chips or tiny cracks, any substantial damage requires replacement of the smooth glass-ceramic surface. You shouldn't use the cooktop (or the oven if your cooktop is part of a range or stove) until you repair or replace it.\nPreventive cooktop maintenance\nThe most important thing you can do to prevent cooktop malfunctions is to keep your cooktop clean. Scheduling annual appliance maintenance service also ensures your Kelvinator cooktop will work efficiently and effectively. Professional cooktop maintenance can prevent costly, unexpected repairs over time and extend the life of your appliance.\nWhen you request the Kitchen Appliance Clean & Maintain package, your Sears Home Services technician will inspect your cooktop and other kitchen appliances for proper functioning, wear and tear, and water or gas leaks, while also cleaning internal components.\nWhy choose Sears Home Services for Kelvinator cooktop repair?\nOur appliance repair experts know Kelvinator cooktops\nSears Home Services experts are certified in servicing Kelvinator cooktops, as well as cooktops and major appliances from other manufacturers.

If the igniter continues clicking without ignition or you smell gas, turn off the cooktop immediately and schedule professional cooktop repair service to inspect it safely.&lt;/p&gt;\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"Can I replace a Kelvinator cooktop glass surface myself?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"&lt;p&gt;While it’s possible to replace a Kelvinator smooth-top glass surface, it requires precision and care. The cooktop must be removed from its mount, and all internal components must be handled without damaging wiring or heating elements. For safety and proper fit, it&apos;s recommended to hire a professional technician experienced in Kelvinator cooktop repair to perform the replacement&lt;/p&gt;\"}}]}",

Regardless of where you bought the cooktop, we'll keep it running. Plus, we'll even offer a discount on a new cooktop if you decide against repairs.\nOur 1,500+ appliance repair technicians nationwide bring an average of 10 years of experience in appliance repairs for many major brands such as Maytag, Whirlpool, Kenmore, Amana, Frigidaire, Samsung, Viking, KitchenAid, Thermador, Miele, Hotpoint, and Bosch. Our cooktop repair experts service hundreds of thousands of cooking appliances each year.\nSears Home Services also offers appliance maintenance plans to extend the life of your Kelvinator cooktop, home appliance warranties to cover many repairs and replacement, and replacement parts for your cooktop through Sears PartsDirect.\nKelvinator cooktop repair issues that we can fix\nRegardless of the type of cooktop you own, the appliance repair experts at Sears Home Services can perform quality Kelvinator cooktop repairs for problems big or small. A service call involves diagnosing the appliance's malfunction and making repairs quickly. A repair technician can also recommend routine maintenance to extend your cooktop's life.\nCooktop indicator lights won't turn on\nMany cooktops have displays with indicator lights for temperature settings. If any displays are malfunctioning, the control switch might have failed or a bulb has burned out.\nGas burners heat up too slowly\nWhen your Kelvinator cooktop gas burners are heating up too slowly, the burner openings emitting the gas could be obstructed or clogged. The good news is that a thorough cleaning will likely solve the problem. Other potential problems are a misaligned burner cap or faulty control valve. Schedule cooktop repair service if cleaning and basic troubleshooting doesn’t fix the problem.\nElectric cooktop burners won't heat up properly\nWhen one of your Kelvinator cooktop's burners won't heat up, the coil element may not have re-engaged properly the last time you removed it to clean the cooktop. If that's not the problem, it might be a faulty element. If a burner fails to mirror the heat setting, it could be a faulty infinite switch.\nDamaged electric coil element\nThe electric coil elements on a cooktop can wear out over time, especially with heavy use. If you see any blisters or breaks in the coil, it has likely lost continuity and needs to be replaced. If you have a glass or ceramic cooktop, the coils are located underneath the surface.\nA burner not heating properly also could be a sign of other problems, such as a damaged receptacle, faulty wiring, or a failed surface element switch.\nGlass cooktop surface is cracked or otherwise damaged\nIt could happen to anybody--a pan or other heavy object slips out of your hand and cracks your glass-ceramic cooktop. A cooktop can also be damaged when a surface element's thermal limiter fails and the burner overheats causing a thermal crack.\nWhile resin touch-up kits may be suitable to repair small chips or tiny cracks, any substantial damage requires replacement of the smooth glass-ceramic surface. You shouldn't use the cooktop (or the oven if your cooktop is part of a range or stove) until you repair or replace it.\nPreventive cooktop maintenance\nThe most important thing you can do to prevent cooktop malfunctions is to keep your cooktop clean. Scheduling annual appliance maintenance service also ensures your Kelvinator cooktop will work efficiently and effectively. Professional cooktop maintenance can prevent costly, unexpected repairs over time and extend the life of your appliance.\nWhen you request the Kitchen Appliance Clean & Maintain package, your Sears Home Services technician will inspect your cooktop and other kitchen appliances for proper functioning, wear and tear, and water or gas leaks, while also cleaning internal components.\nWhy choose Sears Home Services for Kelvinator cooktop repair?\nOur appliance repair experts know Kelvinator cooktops\nSears Home Services experts are certified in servicing Kelvinator cooktops, as well as cooktops and major appliances from other manufacturers. From regular maintenance to troubleshooting a major issue, our experienced appliance repair experts can help keep your appliance running smoothly.\nWhen you’re searching for gas cooktop repair near me, you’ll find Sears Home Services technicians in your local area ready to fix any cooktop problem that arises.\nFlexible scheduling\nBreakdowns often occur unexpectedly.

Only magnetic materials, such as cast iron or some stainless steel pans, work with induction cooktops. If a pan is not magnetic, the cooktop will not generate heat. This is one of the few [disadvantages of induction cooking](/blog/disadvantages-of-induction-cooking).\\n\\n### How Induction Cooktops Work\\n[Induction cooktops](/glossary/what-is-an-induction-cooktop) operate by generating an electromagnetic field beneath the glass surface. Only when a magnetic pan is placed on the cooktop does the cookware start to heat up. This concentrates the energy where it's needed, with minimal heat lost to the surrounding area. The cooktop itself remains cool to the touch, except directly under the pan.\\n\\n### Differences Between Induction and Traditional Cooking Methods\\nInduction cooktops heat faster and more efficiently than gas or electric stoves. They provide better control over temperature, allowing quick adjustments for simmering, boiling, or frying, which helps prevent overcooking and ensures more consistent results.\\n\\n## 1. Speed and Precision in Cooking\\n\\nInduction cooking is known for delivering both speed and precision, making it ideal for busy kitchens.\\n\\n### Fast Heat Transfer for Quick Meals\\nInduction cooktops transfer heat directly to the pan, which reduces cooking time significantly. This fast heat transfer allows for quicker meal preparation, boiling water in a fraction of the time compared to traditional stoves.\\n\\n### Precise Temperature Control for Better Results\\nInduction cooktops offer precise control over temperature settings. The ability to adjust heat instantly makes it easier to fine-tune cooking conditions for delicate tasks like simmering sauces or searing meats, resulting in better consistency and reduced risk of burning or undercooking.\\n\\n## 2. Energy Efficiency and Environmental Benefits of Induction Cooking\\n\\nInduction cooking is designed to use energy more efficiently by heating only the cookware, reducing wasted energy. Unlike traditional stoves that heat both the pan and the surrounding air, induction cooktops transfer energy directly to the cookware, resulting in faster cooking and lower energy consumption.\\n\\n### How Induction Cooking Saves Electricity\\nBy focusing energy solely on the pan, induction cooktops require less electricity to achieve the same cooking results. This targeted approach minimizes heat loss, leading to more efficient energy use.\\n\\n### Lowering Utility Bills with Efficient Cooking\\nThe reduced energy waste and quicker heating times contribute to lower utility bills. Homeowners can save on electricity costs with each meal prepared on an induction cooktop.\\n\\n### Reducing Carbon Footprint with Induction\\nWith less electricity required and less energy wasted, induction cooking supports a more sustainable kitchen. Lower energy consumption means a smaller carbon footprint, making induction a more environmentally friendly option compared to traditional gas or electric cooking methods.\\n\\n![benefits of induction cooking-safer cooking](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/24dFrnPi1hByys7qO2o9WP/60c2bdd706b0a21bc1cb4f6bd18dacf9/benefits_of_induction_cooking-safer_cooking.png)\\n\\n## 3. Safety Features of Induction Cooktops\\n\\nOne of the standout features of induction cooktops is their improved safety compared to gas and electric stoves. By directly heating the cookware instead of the surrounding surface, induction cooktops offer a safer option for everyday cooking.\\n\\n### Reduced Burn Risks Compared to Gas and Electric\\nInduction cooking reduces the risk of burns by keeping the cooktop surface cool to the touch, except directly under the pan. Unlike gas flames or electric coils that remain hot even after use, the surrounding area on an induction cooktop stays safe. This makes it less likely for accidental burns to occur, especially in busy kitchens or homes with children, where safety is a priority.\\n\\n### Automatic Shut-Off and Safety Sensors\\nMany induction cooktops come equipped with automatic shut-off features and safety sensors. If the cookware is removed from the cooktop or if the pan overheats, the cooktop will automatically stop heating. These built-in safeguards help prevent fires and overheating, offering peace of mind for homeowners and adding an extra layer of safety to the kitchen.\\n\\n![benefits of induction cooking-easy cleaning](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/1Gi6PEDrOybM7IciLtvxZw/110e24b4af58aa6131ebfc2766cfac87/benefits_of_induction_cooking-easy_cleaning.png)\\n\\n## 4. Easy-to-Clean Surface\\n\\nInduction cooktops are known for their sleek, flat design, which makes cleaning a breeze compared to traditional stoves. With no grates, coils, or burners to worry about, maintaining a clean surface is simple and straightforward. Long-term care is important, as regular cleaning helps prevent scratches and keeps the surface looking new for years to come.\\n\\n### Cleaning Induction Cooktops: Tips for a Sparkling Finish\\nCleaning an induction cooktop is as easy as wiping it down with a soft cloth. Since the cooktop itself doesn't get as hot as traditional stoves, spills are less likely to burn and harden on the surface. A quick wipe with warm water and a mild detergent is usually enough to remove any residue. For tougher spots, a non-abrasive cleaner can help maintain the smooth finish without damaging the glass. To prevent scratches, it’s important to avoid using abrasive sponges or cleaners that could harm the surface over time.\\n\\n### How the Flat Surface Reduces Mess\\nThe flat surface of an induction cooktop keeps messes contained. With no raised burners or coils, spills have nowhere to hide, making it easier to spot and clean up any mess right away. The smooth surface not only reduces the buildup of grime but also allows for faster cleanup after meals, keeping your kitchen looking spotless.\\n\\nProfessional yearly [induction cooktop maintenance service](/maintain/appliance-maintenance) is recommended to keep your induction cooktop and other appliances operating efficiently. Regular maintenance helps preserve their lifespan and performance.\\n\\nInduction cooking combines energy efficiency, precise heat control, enhanced safety, and easy cleaning, making it a smart and modern choice for any kitchen. With its ability to reduce energy consumption and speed up cooking times, it's no surprise that more homeowners are choosing induction cooktops. To keep your appliances running smoothly, regular maintenance is key.
