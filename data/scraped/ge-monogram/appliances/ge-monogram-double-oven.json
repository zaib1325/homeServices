If your double oven has power and the child lock is not engaged (if applicable), there are several possible problems.\nLess expensive fixes include a damaged temperature sensor, infinite switch (electric) or igniter (gas), or a blown fuse. A more expensive repair is to replace the electronic control board which may have failed due to a power surge, a bake element that has shorted out, or some other system failure.\nIf it's a gas double oven and there's also a problem with your gas cooktop, there could be an issue with the house's natural gas line.\nDouble oven won't heat to right temperature\nIf your GE Monogram double oven won't heat to the proper temperature or is overcooking, undercooking, or cooking unevenly, the temperature sensor, temperature control thermostat, or the heating elements might need replacement, or the double oven may need to be recalibrated.\nDouble oven door won't close or unlock\nIf your double oven door won't close, it's likely a problem with the door's lock, seal, or hinges. If your double oven door won't unlock and you don't have a manual release, there could be an issue with the double oven temperature sensor, door lock assembly, or the electronic control board.\nYou can try disconnecting power to the appliance for 30 seconds to see if that will reset the control board and release the lock. In some double ovens, you can initiate the self-clean cycle, then cancel once the lock motor stops to try to reset.\nKeep in mind that double ovens can take up to an hour to cool after self-cleaning, and the lock may not disengage until the double oven has completely cooled.\nDouble oven light won't turn on\nTry replacing the bulb yourself. If that doesn't work, it's probably time to call an appliance repair expert. The problem could be a faulty socket, light switch, connecting wire, or electronic control board.\nPreventive double oven maintenance\nThe most important thing you can do to prevent double oven malfunctions is to keep the interior of the double oven clean. Scheduling annual appliance service ensures your GE Monogram double oven will work efficiently and effectively.

If your double oven has power and the child lock is not engaged (if applicable), there are several possible problems.\nLess expensive fixes include a damaged temperature sensor, infinite switch (electric) or igniter (gas), or a blown fuse.

A service call involves diagnosing the appliance's malfunction and making repairs quickly. A repair technician can also recommend routine maintenance to extend your double oven's life.\nWhen you need professional GE oven repair to fix a problem, schedule an appointment with Sears Home Services.\nDouble oven won't turn on\nThere are various reasons your GE Monogram double oven won't turn on. If your double oven has power and the child lock is not engaged (if applicable), there are several possible problems.\nLess expensive fixes include a damaged temperature sensor, infinite switch (electric) or igniter (gas), or a blown fuse. A more expensive repair is to replace the electronic control board which may have failed due to a power surge, a bake element that has shorted out, or some other system failure.\nIf it's a gas double oven and there's also a problem with your gas cooktop, there could be an issue with the house's natural gas line.\nDouble oven won't heat to right temperature\nIf your GE Monogram double oven won't heat to the proper temperature or is overcooking, undercooking, or cooking unevenly, the temperature sensor, temperature control thermostat, or the heating elements might need replacement, or the double oven may need to be recalibrated.\nDouble oven door won't close or unlock\nIf your double oven door won't close, it's likely a problem with the door's lock, seal, or hinges. If your double oven door won't unlock and you don't have a manual release, there could be an issue with the double oven temperature sensor, door lock assembly, or the electronic control board.\nYou can try disconnecting power to the appliance for 30 seconds to see if that will reset the control board and release the lock. In some double ovens, you can initiate the self-clean cycle, then cancel once the lock motor stops to try to reset.\nKeep in mind that double ovens can take up to an hour to cool after self-cleaning, and the lock may not disengage until the double oven has completely cooled.\nDouble oven light won't turn on\nTry replacing the bulb yourself. If that doesn't work, it's probably time to call an appliance repair expert. The problem could be a faulty socket, light switch, connecting wire, or electronic control board.\nPreventive double oven maintenance\nThe most important thing you can do to prevent double oven malfunctions is to keep the interior of the double oven clean. Scheduling annual appliance service ensures your GE Monogram double oven will work efficiently and effectively. It can also prevent costly, unexpected repairs over time and extend the life of your appliance.\nWhen you request the Kitchen Appliance Clean & Maintain package, your Sears Home Services technician will inspect your double oven and other kitchen appliances for proper functioning, wear and tear, and water or gas leaks, while also cleaning internal components.\nWhy choose Sears Home Services for GE Monogram double oven repair?\nOur appliance repair experts know GE Monogram double ovens\nSears Home Services experts are certified in servicing GE Monogram double ovens, as well as double ovens and major appliances from other manufacturers.

If your double oven has power and the child lock is not engaged (if applicable), there are several possible problems. \\n\\nLess expensive fixes include a damaged temperature sensor, infinite switch (electric) or igniter (gas), or a blown fuse. A more expensive repair is to replace the electronic control board which may have failed due to a power surge, a bake element that has shorted out, or some other system failure. \\n\\nIf it's a gas double oven and there's also a problem with your gas cooktop, there could be an issue with the house's natural gas line. \\n\\n### Double oven won't heat to right temperature\\n\\nIf your GE Monogram double oven won't heat to the proper temperature or is overcooking, undercooking, or cooking unevenly, the temperature sensor, temperature control thermostat, or the heating elements might need replacement, or the double oven may need to be recalibrated. \\n\\n### Double oven door won't close or unlock\\n\\nIf your double oven door won't close, it's likely a problem with the door's lock, seal, or hinges. If your double oven door won't unlock and you don't have a manual release, there could be an issue with the double oven temperature sensor, door lock assembly, or the electronic control board. \\n\\nYou can try disconnecting power to the appliance for 30 seconds to see if that will reset the control board and release the lock. In some double ovens, you can initiate the self-clean cycle, then cancel once the lock motor stops to try to reset.\\n\\n Keep in mind that double ovens can take up to an hour to cool after self-cleaning, and the lock may not disengage until the double oven has completely cooled.\\n\\n### Double oven light won't turn on\\n\\nTry replacing the bulb yourself. If that doesn't work, it's probably time to call an appliance repair expert. The problem could be a faulty socket, light switch, connecting wire, or electronic control board. \\n\\n### Preventive double oven maintenance\\n\\nThe most important thing you can do to prevent double oven malfunctions is to keep the interior of the double oven clean. Scheduling annual appliance service ensures your GE Monogram double oven will work efficiently and effectively.

You'll also learn about the average cost to expect for materials and installation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Vinyl Siding Cost by Type\\n\\n### Vinyl Shake Siding\\n\\nThe cost of vinyl shake siding can vary significantly based on several factors, such as the brand, quality, style, location, and the size of the project.\\nOn average, the cost of vinyl shake siding can range from $6 to $15 per square foot, including materials and installation. This cost may also vary depending on the complexity of the installation process, any additional features, and the contractor's labor charges.\\n\\n### Insulated Vinyl Siding\\n\\nYou may choose siding with additional insulation, particularly if your house tends to be poorly insulated. \\nThe average cost of installing insulated vinyl siding can range from $5 to $16 per square foot. This price includes the cost of the insulated siding, labor, and other installation expenses. Keep in mind that these are just estimates, and the actual cost might be different in your specific area and depending on your particular project details.\\n\\n### Board and Batten\\n\\nBoard and batten vinyl siding provides a bold look for cottage style homes. On average, the cost of board and batten vinyl siding can range from $5 to $10 per square foot for materials and installation. The average cost can vary depending on where you live and the details of your siding project.\\n\\n### Clapboard Siding\\n\\nVinyl clapboard siding mimics the look of overlapping horizontal wood planks. This is one of the most popular types of vinyl siding. Clapboard vinyl siding typically costs between $5 and $12 per square foot to install. The actual cost to install clapboard siding on your home will depend on the type of siding that you choose, complexity of the installation process, any additional features, and the contractor's labor charges.\\n\\n### Vertical Vinyl Siding\\n\\nThe cost of vertical vinyl siding can range from $3 to $9 per square foot for materials only. You’ll need to add the cost of siding installation by a local contractor to figure the total cost of your project.\\n\\n### Vinyl Log Siding\\nVinyl log siding is a type of exterior cladding for buildings that replicates the appearance of traditional log cabins or log homes. It’s designed to mimic the natural and rustic look of wood logs. The cost of this siding typically ranges from $5 to $10 per square foot. This estimate includes the cost of materials and labor. However, keep in mind that prices can vary significantly based on your location and the specific contractor you choose.\\n\\n### Vinyl Stone Siding\\n\\nVinyl stone siding comes in panels or tiles that are manufactured to resemble various types of natural stones, such as limestone, slate, or river rock. The panels are molded or embossed with textures and patterns that replicate the look and feel of genuine stone.\\n\\nThe cost of installing vinyl stone siding varies according to the type of stone that you choose and the area that you live in. This type of siding typically costs between $7 and $15 per square foot to install including materials and labor.\\n\\n### Vinyl Brick Siding\\n\\nVinyl brick siding is made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and is commonly used to cover and protect the exterior walls of homes. The cost of installing vinyl brick siding typically costs from $7 to $15 per square foot. The specific cost of covering your home with vinyl brick siding may vary based on your location and the cost of labor charged by local contractors.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Factors to Consider When Calculating Vinyl Siding Cost\\n\\nHow much your vinyl siding will cost depends on many factors in addition to the particular quality of siding you choose. The total area of your home’s exterior will determine the amount of siding needed. If your home is irregularly shaped, this makes for a more challenging installation and can result in more scrap and man-hours.\\n\\nIf you are not doing the installation yourself, there are labor costs to consider. If you need to remove your old siding before installation, this will add to the total, as well.\\n\\nThe [cost of siding](https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/siding/install-siding/) typically runs between $3 and $12 per square foot. You can approximate the exterior of your home as rectangles and triangles to estimate the total area. The area of any rectangular space is the base x height. The area of any triangular spaces is ½ base x height. The total area is the sum.\\n\\nYou can then multiply the total estimated area by the unit price to get the total cost of the siding. For example, if your home has an exterior area of 1,200 square feet, the total cost would be between $2 x 1,200 = $2,400 and $7 x 1,200 = $8,400.\\n\\nBut other materials you need to consider are nails, trim pieces, and so on. Soffits or fascia pieces may be anywhere from $1 and $20 per linear foot, depending on the material chosen. It’s also often a good idea to include 10% additional material, as this is often how much waste is produced by cutting pieces to the appropriate size.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How to Reduce Vinyl Siding Costs\\n\\nHere are some tips to help you lower the overall cost of your home siding replacement project.\\n\\n* Start by researching different vinyl siding options and suppliers. Compare prices from multiple vendors to find the best deals and discounts.\\n* If you have the necessary skills and experience, consider installing the vinyl siding yourself. DIY installation can save you money on labor costs.\\n* Higher-grade vinyl siding may offer better durability and aesthetics, but it can also be more expensive. Opt for mid-grade or budget-friendly vinyl siding that meets your needs and budget.\\n* Vertical siding can be less expensive than traditional horizontal siding. Additionally, it can give your home a unique and modern look.\\n* Inquire about any energy efficiency rebates or incentives available for choosing certain vinyl siding options. These rebates can help offset the initial costs.\\n* If your budget is tight, explore financing options that offer low-interest rates or special deals on home improvement projects.\\n\\nLocal service providers often offer several favorable financing options to help you complete your vinyl siding installation affordably. Explore these options with a siding consultant in your area to begin your vinyl siding installation.\"])",

Routine cleaning and lubrication, inspecting and tightening electrical connections, and replacing worn parts are key to maintaining optimal performance.\\n\\nCleaning and lubricating the moving parts of your garage door opener with a silicone-based lubricant can reduce friction and ensure smooth operation. Moreover, inspecting and tightening electrical connections can prevent erratic operation or garage opener light blinking. Finally, worn-out components such as springs, belts, and chains should be replaced to maintain optimal functionality. If you're unsure about performing these tasks, consider seeking professional assistance.\\n\\nChecking garage door travel is often an essential DIY troubleshooting step in resolving garage door opener problems that cause error codes. Follow the detailed steps in this helpful YouTube video to resolve travel problems with your garage door:\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/giZuLTMIOzc\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\n## Reason 2: Safety Sensor Problems -- Resolving Photo Sensor Issues\\n\\nA common reason for the Liftmaster blinking light on your garage door opener could be photo sensor issues. Photo sensors, which detect obstacles to prevent accidents, are a crucial safety feature.

The light blinks 10 times on many garage door openers to signify a problem with the safety sensors.

If the problem persists, consider resetting the photo sensor alignment as per your garage door opener's manual. If you're uncertain about performing these tasks, don't hesitate to contact a professional garage door technician for help.\\n\\n## Reason 3: Wiring Failures -- Addressing Wiring Problems\\n\\nWiring issues could be another reason why your Liftmaster blinking light is flashing an error code.

Inspecting the wiring connections, repairing or replacing damaged wires, and ensuring proper electrical connections can help eliminate garage opener light blinking and ensure the smooth operation of your garage door opener.

A wiring diagram shows a map of the wires that connect all of the circuits in an appliance. \\n\\nWhen a component fails, you can trace the circuit through that component to know what to physically check to diagnose the failure.\\n\\nView this video to see an example of tracing a circuit and diagnosing a component failure in a refrigerator.\\n\\n\\u003ciframe width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yUKSrh59v4Q\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen\\u003e\\u003c/iframe\\u003e\\n\\nAs shown in the video, you’ll need a [multimeter](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/product/2lghb1rknn-0092-207/id-utldm1) to check wiring and components in an appliance when diagnosing a failure. Our [How to use a multimeter to test electrical parts video](https://www.searspartsdirect.com/diy/article/how-to-use-a-multimeter-to-test-electrical-parts-video) shows you how.\\n\\n![Multimeter for diagnosing appliance failures](//images.ctfassets.net/e0821f6q5nel/225BIGjnHOmVDM3aJxAvOY/bf1019a27454ca0f563a44da2eeb539b/Multimeter_for_diagnosing_appliance_failures.png)\\n\\nAccurately diagnosing a failure using a wiring diagram and multimeter will help you buy the right part so you can get the appliance working again. \\n\\nCircuits in appliances can be more complicated than the one shown in the above video, but you can use this basic method of tracing and testing a circuit to understand possible causes of failures in your appliances.\\n\\nWhen working on your appliances, always heed this warning:\\n\\n**Undertaking repairs or maintenance to appliances or power equipment can be hazardous. Should you choose to undertake repairs or maintenance, you are assuming the risk of injury to your person or property. In an effort to reduce the risk, use the proper tools and safety equipment noted in the applicable guide and follow all instructions. Always** __UNPLUG__ **the appliance or disconnect electrical power by shutting off the house circuit breaker before beginning diagnosis and/or repair. Do not proceed until you are confident that you understand all of the steps and are capable of completing the repair. Some repairs or maintenance, however, should only be performed by a qualified technician.**\\n\\n[Schedule in-home service by a Sears Technician](/repair) when you encounter an appliance failure that you can’t fix yourself. \\nSears Technicians perform more than 3 million repairs annually and we have 1,500+ appliance experts employed nationwide.
