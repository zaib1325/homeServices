Our certified technicians are equipped to handle a wide range of issues, ensuring your oven operates at peak performance.\nWe understand both the technical complexity of double ovens and the urgency you feel when problems arise. Our factory-trained technicians bring specialized expertise to diagnose and repair every type of oven failure.\nWith thousands of local appliance technicians across the US, Sears has local repair technicians near you who are highly skilled and trained to fix your double wall oven. Sears technicians are factory trained to repair all major brands of double ovens including Frigidaire, GE, Whirlpool and Kenmore.\nChoose the nationwide leader in appliance repair to repair your double oven when it breaks down.\nCommon Double Oven Failures We Fix\nUneven Heating\nHere are the top causes of oven temperature issues:\n\nControl thermostat needs calibration.\nOven door seal needs replacing.\nFaulty temperature sensor or thermostat.\nHeating element problems.\nGas oven igniter issues.\nElectronic control board failure.\nOven door hinge problems.\n\nFixing an oven temperature issue can sometimes be as easy as adjusting or calibrating the oven control. Over time, the temperature setting on your oven can drift away from the factory setting. The temperature settings on your oven might not match the actual temperature inside.\nWhen you notice heat escaping through the oven door, uneven cooking or your oven takes a long time to preheat, check the oven door seal because a damaged seal will cause these types of problems. Also, check the oven door hinges because hinge problems can cause uneven heating.\nBoth baking and broiling elements play a crucial role in maintaining the oven temperature. If any of them are faulty, the oven won’t heat properly.\nThe electronic control board manages various oven functions, including temperature regulation. Malfunctions in the control board can lead to temperature inconsistencies.\nIf you're unable to find and fix the cause of the uneven heating, schedule appliance repair service to have a technician diagnose and fix the heating failure.\nMalfunctioning Controls\nControl panels wear out over time. Labels eventually rub off and control buttons stop working after years of use. Internal contacts and display components can fail at any time. When your oven control panel wears out or stops working, have a service technician install a new control panel.\nNormal wear and tear eventually takes it toll on a circuit board and causes its failure. A short circuit in a component such as a heating element, fan, control panel or sensor can damage the electronic control board. A service tech can often determine the cause of a control board failure and replace additional parts if necessary to prevent the control board from going out shortly after replacing it.\nDoor Seal Problems\nA bad door seal will allow heat to escape from the oven. Check the door seal for damage and replace it if necessary.\nWhy Choose Sears Home Services\n\nSame-day and next-day repair options in many areas\nCertified and insured local technicians\nGenuine replacement parts\nSatisfaction guarantee\nOver 7,000 5-star customer reviews",
