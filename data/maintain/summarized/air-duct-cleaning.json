Your furnace filter traps some of this airborne debris—if you replace your filter when it’s dirty—but some settles in the ductwork. That accumulated dirt is available to move back into the airflow and blow into your rooms. Your furniture and floors get dusty sooner, but worse, your home’s air quality can deteriorate. If you have respiratory problems, you might find it more difficult to breath. If you suffer from seasonal allergies, you can be exposed to pollen all year long. Dirty ducts also make your heating and cooling system less efficient. The filter clogs faster, so the system has to work harder to move air—and you can end up with a higher energy bills. Also, particles of dirt wear on the components in your HVAC system, which can shorten its life."
